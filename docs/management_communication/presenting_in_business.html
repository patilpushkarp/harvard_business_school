<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Communication apprehension (fear of public speaking) is normal, but it can be a problem when it is intense and chronic. There is even a medical term for extreme cases: glossophobia.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Being the focus of attention in a room and having sole responsibility for making something happen can stimulate fear. The fear creates a vicious circle.

<h3>Overreliance on Slides<a class="headerlink" href="#overreliance-on-slides" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Quite a few speakers have come to regard slides as the presentation, not as a complement to the presentation. And when the attitude that “more is better” encounters feature-rich presentation software, speakers can saturate audiences with information: slide after slide of bullet points, charts, tables, and graphs filled with so much content and formatting clutter that they are unreadable. Slides that convey too much create a dilemma for audience members.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Most audiences try to read the slide text or listen to the presenter simutaneously, splitting their attention and lessening the amount of information they can take in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Presenters can unwittingly use PowerPoint as a means of coping with stage fright. Slides can shift attention away from them. No longer are they speakers connecting with an audience; they are narrators of a slideshow. Even their posture can protect them from contact with the audience. To read the slides, they turn their backs to the listeners.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Most business audiences have sat through scores of presentations in school and on the job, and the odds are that many of them were boring and delivered too much information. Presentation fatigue is therefore a characteristic of business audiences. Very quickly, audience members can enter a state of minimal attention—a habit formed from many disappointing experiences.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Facing a Hostile Audience<a class="headerlink" href="#facing-a-hostile-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Provocative audience members can lead you to responses that sour the attitudes of all audience members toward you.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Try to keep in mind that negative feelings toward someone in the audience will distract you from what you are there for: to address everyone in the room, not spar with one member. You may not be able to persuade everyone. Do your best, but you should not halt your presentation to try to convince one person.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practical suggestions for responding to hostile audience behavior:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disagreement: Someone interrupts you to dispute what you are saying. If the person has a legitimate point, acknowledge it (for example, “You have a point and thanks for sharing it”) and resume your presentation. When you think the objection is not valid, acknowledge it by saying something innocuous (for example, “That is an interesting point”) and move on.</p></li>
<li><p>Interruptions: An individual either starts talking and will not stop or frequently interrupts. Ask the person to talk to you after the presentation. If that does not solve the problem, say something like: “I want everyone to hear my ideas and decide for themselves whether they make sense. I’d like you to listen to the rest of my presentation and then we can talk afterward.”</p></li>
<li><p>Arguments: An audience member becomes argumentative. Grant her the right to an opinion, recognize the difference between the two of you, and move on. If the individual persists in arguing, try the approach described in the previous suggestion.</p></li>
<li><p>Side Conversation: Two people in the audience talk to each other during your presentation. Ignore brief conversations, but when individuals persist in talking, walk toward them and make and hold eye contact.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>“Note that the development of a presentation begins with creating and organizing ideas, not with PowerPoint or other presentation software.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“When used well, slides visually reinforce the essential ideas of a presentation. A presentation begun in PowerPoint starts with the reinforcement rather than the ideas and fosters the view that the slides are the presentation. That view may encourage a presenter to build a large slide deck crammed with information. And it may undercut a presenter’s motivation to engage with the people in the room.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“A large body of research demonstrates that people learn more through a combination of sight and hearing than through one or the other alone. Slides therefore have an essential function as a learning channel parallel to speech—but not superior to it.”</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Presenters also have to contend with the time an audience can concentrate. As you have learned, every speaker is engaged in a continuous competition for audience members’ attention, attracting it, losing it, and bringing it back.

<h3>Communication Apprehension<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-apprehension" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Nearly everyone gets nervous before they present. That is not a problem. In fact, nervousness is a natural performance enhancer. It energizes speakers and makes them more alert, focused, and attuned to the situation. But too much nervousness can be a problem.”</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>“Communication apprehension can have long-term consequences. Individuals who suffer from it can dodge opportunities to speak and improve. Sadly, research has shown that communication apprehension reduces academic performance, limits career choices, spoils job interviews, and erodes satisfaction with work.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Causes of Communication Apprehension<a class="headerlink" href="#causes-of-communication-apprehension" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Research has identified three causes of communication apprehension: the situation, the audience, and the speaker’s goals.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Situation: Physical aspects of speaking, such as the room or the number of people</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example: Speaking to a large number of people</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Audience: The people the speaker is addressing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example: A non-native speaker of English presenting to an audience of native English speakers</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Goals: The speaker’s desired outcome</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example: Asking the audience for a large sum of money to keep a company afloat</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Locating your greatest sources of anxiety can inform the coping strategies.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coping-strategies">
<h4>Coping Strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#coping-strategies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Research has identified numerous practices for coping with communication apprehension. Here are seven that are widely used.”</strong></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Welcoming Anxiety: Anxiety about speaking should never surprise you. If you have felt it before, you should expect to feel it again. Allow the anxiety to unfold; it is not an alien force taking over your body. But be prepared. An expert on communication apprehension recommends that you write out an anxiety management plan describing how you will respond. Any of the six remaining tactics can be part of the plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruction and Practice: As you become more skilled at something, you worry about it less. People who do not like presenting often try to avoid it. But instruction and practice can help build confidence and be conducive to other ways of reducing communication apprehension.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualization: Visualization can also build self-confidence. It involves making a movie in your head of a successful presentation. Visualization helps only when you imagine the entire performance, not a single scene from it, and for several days in a row prior to speaking.</p></li>
<li><p>Reframing: When you reframe something, you change the way you think about it. A speaker who is anxious about the audience can reframe them as people who are interested in his topic and open to what he has to say. You feel vulnerable if you view a presentation as a solo performance with all eyes on you. But you can reframe it by practicing it as a conversation with a friend. You can also deal with the anxiety that all eyes are on you by “sharing the stage” with a video, a prop, audience participation, or a co-presenter.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing Thoughts and Feelings: Expressing yourself in writing can lessen anxiety. Answer questions such as: What are my greatest fears about public speaking? What is the worst thing that can happen if I don’t present well? Putting fears into writing makes them concrete. When they are in writing, you have a chance to reflect on them, considering whether they are realistic. You can write down positives about the presentation you will give. For example, you might say that you are grateful to have a chance to talk about a topic that’s important to you. Regardless of the content of the writing, it is most effective when you do it regularly. You also can record your thoughts and feelings after a presentation, creating a baseline for your speaking experience grounded in reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Positive Self-Talk: Negative self-talk can be self-fulfilling by stoking fear. Positive self-talk can do the opposite—focusing you on positives such as the fact that your accent has never been a serious impediment to communication. You can script your self-talk by reading from positive written comments you have written previously.</p></li>
<li><p>Staying in the Present: Fear of consequences from an unsuccessful presentation can trigger communication apprehension. Because those consequences are in the future, an antidote is staying in the present before and while you speak. With a racing mind and stressed body, you cannot will yourself into the present. You need to engage in an activity that grounds you. Techniques for grounding include listening to music, challenging exercise (such as running up stairs), counting backward, and meditation.</p></li>

<li><p>We can train our voice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Voice communicates something about who you are and your feelings about what you are telling the audience.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Five characteristics of your speaking voice are critical:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Projection</p></li>

<h4>Projection<a class="headerlink" href="#projection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Projection is how well a person’s voice carries. The goal is to speak so that the person farthest away from you can clearly hear your words. Achieving the goal can be a problem if you have a soft speaking voice.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Projection does not require you to shout. If you talk much louder than you normally do, you strain your vocal cords and alienate listeners. To project, do the following:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stand erect but not rigidly.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak from your diaphragm rather than your throat.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“Good posture helps the body produce more resonant speech. Speaking from the diaphragm projects your voice better than speaking from the throat and saves wear and tear on your vocal muscles. If the room is large, consider using a microphone.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Using your diaphragm for speech takes practice. Try the following suggestions:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Take a few breaths while concentrating on pulling the air in with your diaphragm—this is called belly breathing. It also triggers a relaxation response, which can be useful to calm nerves. Put your hand on your stomach; if you are breathing from the diaphragm, you should feel a pronounced in and out movement.</p></li>
<li><p>After you get a feel for belly breathing, hum as you expel air. This exercise lets you experience what making sounds from the area below your lungs feels like.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue belly breathing. Try saying a single word as you expel air. Then try saying the word from your throat. You should feel a difference.</p></li>

<h4>Emphasis<a class="headerlink" href="#emphasis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Listening to a monotone is not only fatiguing for an audience, but it also strips away a dimension of meaning. We change the pitch of our voices as part of the meaning of spoken words, especially to signal significance. All words in a sentence do not have the same importance. The voice tells listeners which ones are and are not.”</strong></p></li>

<div class="section" id="rate-of-speech">
<h4>Rate of Speech<a class="headerlink" href="#rate-of-speech" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“You have no doubt heard speakers whose concern to get through a presentation as quickly as possible caused them to speak rapidly. Rapid speaking can be a side effect of nervousness. The faster they talked, the less likely it is that you listened carefully.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Rapid speech has another bad effect from the audience’s point of view: It eliminates emphasis on key words.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Talk at a comfortable pace. Monitor your rate by making audio or video recordings of your rehearsals.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tone">
<h4>Tone<a class="headerlink" href="#tone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Tone expresses how speakers feel about the topic and the people they are speaking to. Many speakers unwittingly adopt a tone that does not make a good impression on listeners. Speaking in a monotone or a colorless tone of voice may be due to nerves or a consequence of reciting from memory. However, listeners can hear this tone of voice as boredom, indifference, or fear.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Be very careful about a negative tone. It may be appropriate on rare occasions, but in general that type of tone will complicate or sever a connection with the audience.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Practicing a presentation by delivering it to a friend will help you maintain a conversational tone—one that has energy and positive feeling.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Verbal Fillers<a class="headerlink" href="#verbal-fillers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Uh, ah, and um and phrases such as you know and like—these sounds and phrases are verbal fillers because they fill what otherwise would be silence. Occasional fillers are not a problem, but when they are frequent, they distract and annoy listeners. This problem has a simple solution: Replace the fillers with silent pauses.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“While the solution is conceptually simple, the implementation is difficult. Fillers are habits so they need to be ushered out of an individual’s vocabulary gradually. Also, speakers tend to be afraid of silence and often have an exaggerated sense of how long a silence lasts, even though audiences do not notice when speakers pause or they quickly forget that they did.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Here are suggestions for gradually eliminating fillers:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start monitoring how you use them in everyday conversations.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="facial-expression">
<h4>Facial Expression<a class="headerlink" href="#facial-expression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Smiling is a vital element of immediacy behavior.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Anxiety about speaking can lead to a blank or frowning face. The people in the room do not know what you are feeling; they can only go on what they see and hear. From their viewpoint, you may appear slightly hostile, unhappy about having to present, or uninterested in the topic and them.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“You want the audience to like you. When people smile at you, you tend to like them—that is a well-documented psychological response.”</strong></p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Whether you are moving or standing still, face the audience as much as possible and look at audience members in their eyes. That keeps you connected with them. Try not to stand in one place, rotating your head back and forth to scan the audience.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“At a visceral level, we have negative feelings about people who won’t look us in the eye. This reaction is not a conscious judgment. It happens automatically and can color our attitude toward the speaker without our being aware of it.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“In certain cultures, steady eye contact is not regarded as a positive behavior. As always, you have to be sensitive to the cultural context.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“One of the biggest liabilities of presentation slides is that they exert an almost magnetic attraction on the presenter’s eyes. All of us have stared at the back of presenters who seem mesmerized by their own slides—and probably all of us have turned our own backs to an audience.

<h4>Posture<a class="headerlink" href="#posture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“When speakers stand erect but relaxed they seem comfortable with us, and we usually feel comfortable with them. As for the perennial question of what to do with your hands, when they are not doing something—such as making gestures—put them where nature did: at your sides.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Slumped shoulders, a rigid body, standing sideways to the audience for long periods—all of these postures signal a presenter’s discomfort, which is readily communicated to audiences.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Even the position and movement of your head can affect audiences. In psychological studies, people tend to perceive a slightly raised head as expressing confidence or happiness and a lowered head as meaning sadness or submission.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“A head tilted to the right or left is usually seen as a desire for rapport, although when combined with a negative facial expression such as a frown, it communicates disagreement or disapproval.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="movement">
<h4>Movement<a class="headerlink" href="#movement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Movement helps maintain the audience’s focus on you. Remember that people have three systems of attention and one, alerting, is sensitive to movements.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Maintain purposeful movement while you speak. For example, walk toward part of the audience, make eye contact with individuals, and then walk toward another part of the audience and again make eye contact. Return to a spot in the front of the audience and stand for a few moments. Then repeat the process, but approach different parts of the audience than you did the first time.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Gesture<a class="headerlink" href="#gesture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<li><p><strong>“Gesturing helps people think. Scientists speculate that the movement of arms and hands makes people’s thoughts more concrete. The gesture–thought connection implies that suppressing gestures can make speaking more difficult.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Some people say that they feel exposed and awkward with their hands at their sides. They want to do something with their arms that makes them feel safer. Instead of fighting the tendency to clasp hands or put them behind your back, keep them at waist level, close together but not clasped. The hands need to be free so that you can gesture with them.”</strong></p></li>

<h3>Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#practice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“You should spend more time practicing your presentation than actually delivering it.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Speaking involves both mind and body and the only to get better at is practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Presentation practice has a memory component—learning the content of the presentation so that you can deliver it fluently but not memorizing anything more than a few sentences, if that.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Presentation practice has emotional and physical components. You should get used to smiling and other immediacy behaviors as you speak. Monitor your speaking voice for a positive tone. Allow your hands and arms to gesture naturally, move forward, and maintain a comfortable posture. Practicing silently in your head may help you remember the content, but it does nothing for the other elements of your presentation.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Researchers who study memory recommend fairly brief periods of practice (10 to 15 minutes), short breaks, and then tests of what you have learned. Studying chunks of content and other aspects of the presentation followed by self-tests to see if you can perform the chunk without major mistakes leads to better retention than studying all of the content at once, along with all the slide changes, movements, and other details of speaking.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“You also are better off practicing different parts of the presentation rather than practicing one part over and over. If you have divided your presentation into smaller parts, practice them one at a time.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Memory Aids<a class="headerlink" href="#memory-aids" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“The best memory aid is practice. The ideal is to speak without notes. An individual speaking to the audience without referring to notes or constantly looking at her slides helps establish a strong connection to the audience and enhances how they perceive her.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“But a memory aid, such as an outline, is helpful as a reference. Memory aids can make a presenter feel more secure, because he has recourse if he forgets. Slides can serve the same purpose as notes, but be sure not to become over-dependent on them. If you do, you will have your back turned to listeners and read the slides to them.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Four Ways to Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#four-ways-to-practice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“You should try to practice in the room where you will be speaking. The venue makes a difference: Speaking in a small conference room differs markedly from speaking in a large room or auditorium. For example, voice projection and movement are variables that depend on the size of the space.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Practicing in the room where you will speak gives you an opportunity to check conditions such as lighting and equipment.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Four ways to practice:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Use Video</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Watching a video of your rehearsals is probably the most effective teaching tool available other than audience feedback. Most people do not like looking at themselves on video. Recruiting a friend to watch with you can moderate the tendency to harsh self-criticism.</p></li>
<li><p>For realistic practice, ask several friends to serve as the audience. Have them sit on your right and left so you can get used to moving and making eye contact with the audience. Ask them for honest feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of cellphones with video cameras, recording is easy. You can have a friend record you or do it yourself by placing a phone on a flat surface or using an inexpensive mini-tripod.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Use a Trusted Audience</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rehearse in front of a trusted audience without recording yourself. Arrange the audience members as described in number 1. Then ask them for feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Practice with a Mirror</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Practicing in front of a mirror can help you work on specific visual aspects of delivery such as posture. As you watch, you can change the way you are standing or refine a gesture in real time. However, watching yourself in a mirror can be distracting and can encourage bad habits such as not moving.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Practice without a Mirror</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rehearsing by yourself without a mirror or video camera is better than no rehearsal—as long as you talk out loud. You might feel self-conscious sometimes, but you need to use your voice, as you will in the presentation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>“Watch the body language of the questioner: To strengthen your concentration, note questioners’ nonverbal communication—facial expression, posture (even when seated, people have different postures), and gestures. The information helps you concentrate and assess the questioner’s motivation and attitude.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Understand the question: Be certain that you understand a question. Your job is to answer questions, not sort out vague or confused audience statements. Never answer what you think was asked—ask for clarification. For example, “I have a sense that you don’t find the evidence convincing. If that’s true, tell me why you aren’t persuaded and I can speak to that.” Be alert for questions that give you an opening to reinforce your main points.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Speak to everyone: Repeat the question so that everyone knows what it is. Remember to speak to the whole audience, not the questioner alone.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Accept criticism gracefully: You have to take to heart the fact that no position is without weakness and therefore no presentation is impregnable. In addition, understand that you probably can’t convince everyone in the room. Show respect for critics, even if you think they are wrong, and do not try to deny or hide from fair criticism. What if a questioner has noticed a mistake in the presentation? Thank her for it. It is embarrassing, but it is better to have the chance to correct the mistake than to have audience members realize it later.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Do not fake it—ever: When you do not know the answer to a question, say so. Faking an answer risks destroying your credibility.

<li><p><strong>“Use the plan as a blueprint to assign team members responsibility for the major parts of the presentation. Their first task is generating content. Teams should regularly communicate about progress and discuss any problems that crop up. For example, a team member may find little material for the part she has been assigned. The team can decide whether to change the presentation plan or see if they can help with the research.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Slides and Other Visuals<a class="headerlink" href="#slides-and-other-visuals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“If slides are used, the team should develop a common slide template to ensure a consistent look and feel. Because people have different ideas about slide design, the group should also talk about design principles.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“The team should discuss other visual materials, such as video or props that could enhance the presentation and decide who will be responsible for them.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Having another team member advance slides and handle other media takes some pressure off the speakers and eliminates the need for them to take turns holding the remote.”</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>“Everyone has a unique personality and therefore a unique delivery style. The differences are an advantage because they can keep audience engagement alive.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“But all of the presenters should follow certain best practices. They should express a similar level of emotion, such as enthusiasm, and make similar efforts to engage the audience, such as eye contact and body movement. A high-engagement speaker followed by a low-engagement speaker will jar audience members and possibly cause them to wonder whether the low-engagement presenter believes in the team’s message.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Transitions and Timing<a class="headerlink" href="#transitions-and-timing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“The transitions between the team’s speakers should not be left to improvisation. The team should agree on how to handle them and practice them. One approach to transitions is having each speaker introduce the next one. Or one person can handle the transitions; that person can also open and conclude the presentation.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Presenters can practice their parts on their own, but the team should rehearse the full presentation, including transitions, several times. Team members should give each other honest but constructive feedback.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Careful attention should be paid to how long each person speaks and the total time of the presentation. Adjustments should be made when one person runs long and puts pressure on the speakers that follow to cut short their remarks. Making adjustments in front of the audience is much more stressful than making them in practice sessions.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Speakers can lose track of time in front of an audience. A team member should be responsible for monitoring the time speakers are taking and give a sign agreed on in advance if they do not finish when they are supposed to.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Technical Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“For virtual presentations to be successful, both the speaker and the audience need to know how to use the software. Presenters, therefore, should practice extensively with the application they will use, especially when they are new to it.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Even when they are skilled, however, presenters should have an experienced producer for every event. “</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Experienced producers can save web presentations from disruption. They can be responsible for making sure that participants have correct login information in advance and are able to connect to the event. They can monitor the software during the presentation, troubleshoot, assist participants, and manage communications such as chat and email.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“A virtual event can quickly run into trouble if participants are unfamiliar with the software. Presenters should be sure the audience knows the software before the day of the presentation. If they do not, the presenter should make sure they receive the necessary technical support.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Strengths of Virtual Presentations<a class="headerlink" href="#strengths-of-virtual-presentations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Audience size: The “virtual conference room” of a web-based presentation can accommodate a few participants or hundreds or even thousands.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Distance and Time: Because it is web based, the technology can reach all over the globe and make time differences less important.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Cost: Virtual presentations can be far less expensive than face-to-face meetings if significant travel is involved.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Weaknesses of Virtual Presentations<a class="headerlink" href="#weaknesses-of-virtual-presentations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Audience attention: The competition for the audience’s attention is worse during virtual presentations than live events. Audience members can be doing anything instead of listening and watching—reading and writing emails, texting, or staring out a window.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Nonverbal feedback: Presenters receive no nonverbal feedback from the audience. They can’t read how attentive participants are or their emotions such as confusion, satisfaction, or dissent.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Making a connection: Except when using high-end software, virtual presenters have limited ways of making a connection with the audience: voice, facial expression, simulated eye contact (looking directly at the video camera), limited gestures, and slides and other visual material.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparing-virtual-presentations">
<h4>Preparing Virtual Presentations<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-virtual-presentations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Set realistic limits on presentation content and time: Virtual presenting diminishes the human connection possible in face-to-face encounters, thus making it harder to keep the audience’s attention. So does the fact that participants can do many other things while they are supposed to be paying attention. Therefore, you should cut the content down to the bare essentials and restrain the length of the presentation.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Persuade with the purpose: Prepare a statement about why participants should pay attention to you. Think of them as sitting in their office or home with many options for directing their attention. Give them reasons why they should choose you and your message.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Divide the presentation into short chunks: A presentation consisting of several small chunks with clear boundaries can give the audience a sense of forward progress. The momentum can assist you in keeping them focused. Prepare yourself to describe the structure at the beginning of the presentation.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Build in interactivity: Since the interaction between the speaker and audience is so limited, build in two-way events such as question-and-answer periods, discussions (including calling on audience members by name), problems participants have to work through, polls, games (if appropriate), and teamwork.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Design simple slides and eye-catching visuals: Keep your visual messages as simple as possible and tastefully eye-catching. For example, visually simple charts and graphs in bright colors will attract and hold attention better than tables with rows of numbers.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Practice with the software: Practice the presentation as much as possible, using the software. If the application has the capability, record rehearsals, critique them, and practice again.”</strong></p></li>

<div class="section" id="delivering-virtual-presentations">
<h4>Delivering Virtual Presentations<a class="headerlink" href="#delivering-virtual-presentations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Make a bargain with the audience: Besides telling the audience why they should listen, let them know that in return for their attention, you will keep the presentation moving and end on time. Then clearly state the purpose, structure, and length of the presentation.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Do a sound, video, and interface check: Make sure everyone can hear you (and see you if using video). Check whether any participant is having a technical problem.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Position the camera correctly and speak into it: Check the positioning of the video camera before you begin. It should be at eye level and far enough away that viewers can see you from the waist up. Speak to the camera most of the time.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Pay attention to your voice: Your voice is your main medium of communication in a virtual presentation. For presentations without video, it is your only medium other than text and visuals. Use it wisely. Speak at a moderate rate and modulate for emphasis. Be sure you are talking at a volume comfortable for the listeners.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Use gentle gestures: If you have a video channel, gestures play a role in communicating meaning. So use them, but remember that in the small frame of the typical web video camera, movements are magnified. Try not to move your hands and arms quickly and keep them close to the body.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Do not interpret silence as attention: As the presenter you can’t be constantly worried that people are paying attention. At the same time, silence can be a bad sign. Asking a participant by name if she understands a point you’ve just made shows the audience that you will be monitoring their involvement. Other types of interactivity accomplish the same goal.”</strong></p></li>
