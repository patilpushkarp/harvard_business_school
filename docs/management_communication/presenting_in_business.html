<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Quite a few speakers have come to regard slides as the presentation, not as a complement to the presentation. And when the attitude that “more is better” encounters feature-rich presentation software, speakers can saturate audiences with information: slide after slide of bullet points, charts, tables, and graphs filled with so much content and formatting clutter that they are unreadable. Slides that convey too much create a dilemma for audience members.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Most audiences try to read the slide text or listen to the presenter simutaneously, splitting their attention and lessening the amount of information they can take in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Presenters can unwittingly use PowerPoint as a means of coping with stage fright. Slides can shift attention away from them. No longer are they speakers connecting with an audience; they are narrators of a slideshow. Even their posture can protect them from contact with the audience. To read the slides, they turn their backs to the listeners.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Most business audiences have sat through scores of presentations in school and on the job, and the odds are that many of them were boring and delivered too much information. Presentation fatigue is therefore a characteristic of business audiences. Very quickly, audience members can enter a state of minimal attention—a habit formed from many disappointing experiences.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Facing a Hostile Audience<a class="headerlink" href="#facing-a-hostile-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Provocative audience members can lead you to responses that sour the attitudes of all audience members toward you.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Try to keep in mind that negative feelings toward someone in the audience will distract you from what you are there for: to address everyone in the room, not spar with one member. You may not be able to persuade everyone. Do your best, but you should not halt your presentation to try to convince one person.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practical suggestions for responding to hostile audience behavior:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disagreement: Someone interrupts you to dispute what you are saying. If the person has a legitimate point, acknowledge it (for example, “You have a point and thanks for sharing it”) and resume your presentation. When you think the objection is not valid, acknowledge it by saying something innocuous (for example, “That is an interesting point”) and move on.</p></li>
<li><p>Interruptions: An individual either starts talking and will not stop or frequently interrupts. Ask the person to talk to you after the presentation. If that does not solve the problem, say something like: “I want everyone to hear my ideas and decide for themselves whether they make sense. I’d like you to listen to the rest of my presentation and then we can talk afterward.”</p></li>
<li><p>Arguments: An audience member becomes argumentative. Grant her the right to an opinion, recognize the difference between the two of you, and move on. If the individual persists in arguing, try the approach described in the previous suggestion.</p></li>
<li><p>Side Conversation: Two people in the audience talk to each other during your presentation. Ignore brief conversations, but when individuals persist in talking, walk toward them and make and hold eye contact.</p></li>

<h2>The Message: Enriching the Presentation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-message-enriching-the-presentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“During the planning of a presentation, keep in mind that you have many choices for adding texture, energy, and interest. You do not have to settle for bland explanation and bullet point slides.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="energizing-the-speech-channel">
<h3>Energizing the Speech Channel<a class="headerlink" href="#energizing-the-speech-channel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“You can enliven the speaking part of a presentation with storytelling, audience participation, handouts, and vivid language.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="storytelling">
<h4>Storytelling<a class="headerlink" href="#storytelling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Humans seem to have an inherent interest in stories. When someone starts to tell a story, we generally want to hear how it ends. We watch, read, or listen to thousands upon thousands of stories during our lifetimes and never seem to tire of them. As a presenter, you can use stories to galvanize the attention of people in the room.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Stories help both speakers and listeners remember details. Stories seem to promote longer-term memories in several ways, one of which is the stimulation of emotions. It is no accident that for thousands of years, preliterate societies told or sang stories to communicate information across generations.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audience-participation">
<h4>Audience Participation<a class="headerlink" href="#audience-participation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Audience participation makes presentations two way and stimulates active engagement.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Here are some ways of directly involving the members of your audience:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask a question.</p></li>
<li><p>Present a problem and ask for solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a poll. (You can use handheld digital devices for this.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask them to generate ideas with you.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“To avoid making the presentation too long, audience participation should not require too much time. It should also be voluntary for the audience—you don’t want to put anyone on the spot.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Whatever form the participation takes, it should be connected—and stay connected—to the content. Audience members can slide off onto tangents or irrelevant topics. Be ready to steer the discussion back to the subject or take back the floor. You are responsible to the entire audience and have to protect the time needed to deliver your message.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handouts">
<h4>Handouts<a class="headerlink" href="#handouts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Handouts can reduce the content load of the spoken portion of a presentation, and thus allow time for activities that enliven it.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Handouts can be a takeaway reminder of your key points. They can also furnish additional information or evidence that you do not want to include in the presentation.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Presentation software can print slides, but using them as handouts forces you to make many copies and audience members end up with a stack of paper. Preparing an outline of the presentation in a word-processing program means less paper and more convenience for audiences.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“The best time to distribute handouts is at the end of the presentation, not the beginning. An audience with handouts will be reading them much of the time rather than looking at you.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="vivid-language-quotations">
<h4>Vivid Language: Quotations<a class="headerlink" href="#vivid-language-quotations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Quotations from experts or famous individuals lend credibility to your point of view. Because of the speaker’s authority, a quote can have a greater impact on an audience than your own words.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vivid-language-analogies">
<h4>Vivid Language: Analogies<a class="headerlink" href="#vivid-language-analogies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Analogies compare two things, usually to identify similarities. Analogies can be useful because people learn new ideas better when they can connect them to something they already know.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vivid-language-metaphors">
<h4>Vivid Language: Metaphors<a class="headerlink" href="#vivid-language-metaphors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Metaphors describe something using language unrelated to what is being described. Metaphors can make language more memorable for an audience. Often, they have an emotional impact, too.”</strong></p></li>

<h3>Energizing the Visual Channel<a class="headerlink" href="#energizing-the-visual-channel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“As you know, audiences learn more through the dual channels of hearing and sight than from one or the other. You can use the visual channel for content other than slides, props, and handouts.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“A quick and simple method for adding visual content to a presentation is the traditional flip chart. Like slides, use them to communicate key points. Flip charts can also be used in conjunction with audience participation. For instance, if you ask the audience a question, you can record responses on the flip chart.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Images<a class="headerlink" href="#images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">

<h4>Charts and Other Graphics<a class="headerlink" href="#charts-and-other-graphics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Quantitative information expresses relationships and relationships usually make good visuals. Spreadsheets serve a purpose in handouts, but they are ill suited to presentations because of their visual complexity.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“From spreadsheets and other structured arrangements of numbers, extract the relationships of greatest importance to the presentation: major differences or similarities, relevant increases and decreases, notable trends, critical sequences, and the like.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="videos">
<h4>Videos<a class="headerlink" href="#videos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Video has become a valuable tool for communicating with business audiences. Cellphone video cameras have gotten better and video-editing software is cheaper and easier to use. In addition, some screen-capture applications can create videos for presentations.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Even so, video has to be used carefully, like any other visual content. You should take the less-is-more approach. Video clips should be short—under 30 seconds. Poor-quality video can make the presentation seem unprofessional.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Say that your presentation requires the explanation of a highly technical financial concept. Instead of trying to explain the concept yourself, you can record an in-house expert explaining the point and play the video during the presentation.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="internet-based-technologies">
<h4>Internet-Based Technologies<a class="headerlink" href="#internet-based-technologies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Potential internert-based technologies that can be used during preaentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Youtube: For posting videos.</p></li>
<li><p>Skype: Conferencing application to interact with expert.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet Databases: Structured data can be directly used in the presentations sometimes.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“Technical malfunctions can make using online material perilous. You have to manage the details of web technology before and during the presentation, just like you do display equipment in the room. In addition, you need a contingency plan for technical failures.”</strong></p></li>

<h2>The Message: Preparing Slides and Other Media<a class="headerlink" href="#the-message-preparing-slides-and-other-media" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Slides should be at the end of your presentation to-do list.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“When you start to design slides, do not allow the need for handouts to constrain you. Presenters often use printed versions of their slides as handouts. But effective designs do not necessarily print well. Slides with a solid dark background may be nearly illegible when printed on a black-and-white printer.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“To solve the design conflict between slides and handouts, create separate handouts in a word-processing program.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="slides-as-organizers">
<h3>Slides as Organizers<a class="headerlink" href="#slides-as-organizers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“The visual nature of slides makes them well suited to organizing a presentation for listeners.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“At the beginning of a presentation, provide a roadmap slide of what you are going to say; at the end, provide a summary slide of the points you want the audience to remember. In the body of the presentation, sign post slides tell the audience where they are.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="number-of-slides">
<h3>Number of Slides<a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-slides" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Here is a process for keeping your slide count under control. Imagine that you aren’t going to use any slides for a presentation. Then ask these questions:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the points I will have the hardest time getting across to the audience using only spoken words? Create slides for these points.</p></li>
<li><p>What emotions that align with my purpose could I draw out better using slides instead of spoken words alone? Build emotion into the slides you’ve already created or create new ones.</p></li>
<li><p>What additional slides do I need to assist the audience? Examples are the roadmap and summary slides.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lead-lines-and-bullet-points">
<h3>Lead Lines and Bullet Points<a class="headerlink" href="#lead-lines-and-bullet-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“PowerPoint templates for formatting slide titles assume a headline of a few words. However, in the report of a 2005 study, investigators concluded that one or two full sentences at the top of a slide are better memory aids than headlines. They added a caveat: These lead line sentences need to be short.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Not all slides serve the same purpose, however, and some do not need a lead line.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Probably the majority of presentation slides you have seen had bullet points with a title. For presenters, bullet points let them put a lot of information on a slide. For the audience, they pose a problem. Too often slides have too many bullet points with too much text in each item. Not only do these slides tax the concentration of the audience; but they also are not efficient. Most audiences will remember little or nothing of the detail on them.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Try to limit use of the bullet point design. In many cases, you can do without bullets by putting a single concept on a slide and telling the audience the details.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“When you do use bullet points, keep the items short. When you show the slide, use the “Build” function to display bullet points one at a time. Literate adults automatically read written language. A slide that displays all of the bullet points at once forces viewers to read them, which can cause information overload.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slide-animation">
<h3>Slide Animation<a class="headerlink" href="#slide-animation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Presentation software has many different slide animations, including multiple options for moving text, images, or objects onto the screen. Some animations like builds (the sequential appearance of items) can be useful.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Animation can divert audience members’ attention from the content. And animation quickly becomes stale with repeated use. Animation also takes time; if it is used on many slides, it can lengthen the presentation considerably. Use slide animation sparingly, if at all.”</strong></p></li>

<h3>Designing Effective Slides<a class="headerlink" href="#designing-effective-slides" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<li><p>Simplicity and clarity</p></li>
<li><p>Forcefulness</p></li>
<li><p>Readability</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“To design effective presentation slides, use the following questions as a guide:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the essential point I want to convey with each slide?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the minimum information necessary to understand that point?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I communicate the required information in the most visual way possible? What are the alternatives to bullet points or data-infested charts and tables?</p></li>
<li><p>What other means can I use to share information too dense for a slide? Alternatives include a handout, a document that includes backup information related to the presentation, or a link to a webpage that includes the information.</p></li>

<h4>Simplicity and Clarity<a class="headerlink" href="#simplicity-and-clarity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Simplicity has two dimensions: a manageable amount of information and uncomplicated design. A slide with clarity immediately communicates its meaning.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Good presenters have great faith in their ability to use the data rather than merely display it. They break down complexity into smaller pieces and show how they fit together.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Readability<a class="headerlink" href="#readability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“The benchmark for readability is a yes answer to the following question: Can the person farthest away from the screen read the slides easily?”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“To fit a large amount of text on a slide, the size of the type has to be small. Small type makes slide text hard to read.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Don’t use type smaller than 18 points.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“A second good practice is to have a clear contrast between the type and the background. A lack of contrast reduces readability.”</strong></p></li>
