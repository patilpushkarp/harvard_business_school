Due to time differences and other obstacles, much of their communication is written. Writing skills now play a central role in how well people work together.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Although English has become the common language of international business, differences in the cultural norms of audiences complicate communication across borders. A written report that seems laborious and overly formal to members of a global team in one country may strike team members from another country as well paced and respectful.

<li><p>Information sources are, but not limited to, physical documents, company intranet, online databases, and the web.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“The information can provide compelling evidence for an argument, but it can also lead to information overload that paralyzes thought. Everyone in business experiences some degree of information overload. To limit it when writing, use purpose and audience to set boundaries on the information you need for a message.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Notes can be used for more than recording information. They can be a dialog with your material. You can write down questions you need to answer with research or in the message you will write. You can capture points to include in the writing and begin to map out an organization.”</strong></p></li>

<h4>Writing the draft<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-the-draft" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Here are practices that can make drafting more productive and efficient.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You don’t have to begin at the beginning. - You don’t have to write each section in the order in which it appears in your writing plan. Write what you know, wherever it belongs in the plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t worry about the small stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Correctness and sentence style come later. Turn off the grammar checker. It gets in the way of thinking. Also, most grammar checkers are wrong more often than not. Turn off the spell checker. It’s also a distraction that interrupts thought.</p></li>
<li><p>Grab thoughts in any form. - Capture your thoughts even if they don’t present themselves in complete sentences. When you need a piece of information but know what you want to say about it, don’t interrupt yourself to look for it. You can insert it later.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t stick with a bad plan. - If your writing plan isn’t working, stop and rework the plan. Don’t try to write yourself out of a poor plan.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Once you have a first draft, shift to the audience’s point of view.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The following revision questions ask you to think about the draft from the audience’s point of view.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I included all of the content necessary for my purpose?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the length and amount of detail appropriate for the purpose and the audience?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any gaps or redundancies in the content?</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This is the final stage for making the content audience-ready.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Errors in a written message force readers to perform a fix-up, the process of mentally stopping to correct a mistake and thus understanding the meaning of words or sentences. Each fix-up diverts the reader from the process of building meaning from the message. A large number of fix-ups destroys the coherence of a message.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Correctness also gives you credibility.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Use a grammar checker as a guide, and carefully read for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Turn on the spell checker, but don’t rely on it completely. Proofread your writing to identify spelling errors and mistakes in word usage that the spell checker misses.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Consider these suggestions for correcting a document:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look for words you frequently misspell. - Use the Find and Replace function in a word-processing program. Type misspellings in the search box and see if they occur anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for “personal” grammatical mistakes. - Do you make the same grammar mistakes frequently? Search for them, using the Find and Replace function.</p></li>
<li><p>Use online resources. - For quick answers about grammar, punctuation, and mechanics such as capitalization, use online resources. One of the best is The Owl, a free site developed by Purdue University.</p></li>
<li><p>Concentrate on proofreading. - You may start editing sentences instead of reading them for correctness, making the process longer and potentially missing errors. One trick for avoiding this is to proofread from the end of the document and move backward paragraph by paragraph. Another approach is to underline sentences you want to edit and continue proofreading. You can edit the underlined sentences later.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“In this course, good writing is defined in relation to audiences using American English, in part because it serves as the common language of international business. When using English, however, you may have to adapt it to local audiences.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Basic needs of audiences changes depending on their culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“The contrasts between low-context and high-context cultures have special significance for written communication. Low-context cultures, like those in North America and Europe, tend to value individualism, logic, and action. High-context cultures, like those in Asia, tend to value group membership, personal relationships, and the preservation of consensus. In low-context cultures, readers want authors to state explicitly what they think, to prove it, and to contribute to getting things done. Low-context writing tends to be direct, assertive, and concise. In high-context cultures, readers expect authors to imply much of their meaning, to defer to the group, and to foster consensus. High-context writing tends to be oblique, deferential, and circuitous. One style isn’t superior to the other because each serves the norms and needs of distinct audiences.”</strong></p></li>

You can please audiences by writing messages more concisely than others, but you shouldn’t sacrifice critical points or nuances.

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Email has weaknesses that companies are now starting to recognize. For senders, the weaknesses have implications for writing.”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Limited Message Length: Some topics need longer messages. The short form medium can encourage a writer to condense the message, leaving out crucial content.</p></li>
<li><p>Hasty Writing: Email stimulates a feeling of urgency in users, encouraging them to write hastily. That may be why so many emails are badly written and full of errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Digital Disinhibition - Psychologists have confirmed that people are vulnerable to what they call digital disinhibition when using email. The term means saying things in an email that the writer would never say if the recipient were physically present. People are wired to monitor one another’s reactions and to adjust facial expression, body, gestures, and speech. People receive none of that information when composing an email message. As a result it’s easy for writers to say things they later regret.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Write a short subject line stating the main point of the message. Think of the subject line as a headline.</p></li>

Email applications are poor tools for composing because the interface is full of distractions and the long list of messages creates pressure to work as fast as possible.

<li><p><strong>“Often message-condensing practices actually save few characters. Using them may have less to do with conciseness than confirming the user’s group identity as someone who knows the code.

<li><p>Every business communication has certain format associated with it. Since readers are familiar with those conventions, it is easier for them to know what information is included and where to find something.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“When no convention exists, however, present quantitative relationships graphically when possible. For most audiences, the visualization of these relationships is easier to comprehend than tables of numbers. The same principal applies to nonquantitative graphics such as flowcharts and pictures.

<li><p>Graphics should not be visually cluttered. Simple graphs can convey meaning of the numbers more efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Exhibits, including quantitative graphics and other types of visuals, are best displayed close to the text that discusses them. It’s easier for the writer to put all exhibits at the end of the document, but that placement is less convenient for readers. Each exhibit should have a concise, informative title. In a document with many exhibits, they should also be numbered. You should refer to each exhibit in the text. Be sure to tell readers the significance of every exhibit to the topic you’re discussing.

<h3>Writing in Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-in-teams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In business, most of the writing is team based. <strong>“Multiple authors enrich a document with their different knowledge, experience, and skills, but they also complicate the writing process.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“When a team takes responsibility for writing, they must agree on and understand the purpose.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Most teams need a leader and when they have a written deliverable, the need is more pronounced. A leader can facilitate agreement on a writing plan, set up roles, coordinate and monitor work, and make sure deadlines are met. The leader also needs to keep an eye out for free riders: individuals who let others do the work.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Suggestions for adapting the writing process to teams:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use a writing plan: A team needs a writing plan to establish a common purpose, lay out the organization of the message, and divide tasks. Once a team has a plan, members can agree on their roles. The most straightforward division of labor is for each individual to research and write a part of the document. The team should decide writing conventions to be used such as the point of view (first or third person), levels and styles of headings, and citation form. These decisions can be made later, but someone will then have to edit the report for consistency. Especially for a long report, it’s better to minimize the inconsistencies from the start.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a First Draft: Dividing the team into researchers and writers has some advantages but usually leads to problems. The writers don’t understand the content as well as the researchers, and the writing often takes longer than the research, raising workload issues. For these reasons, it’s better that everyone on the team be responsible for researching and composing a part of the document. When all team members write, they all have a stake in the project. Some individuals might not write well, but if they duck chances to write (or are allowed to by the team), they will not improve. Writing in teams can be a good learning experience and raise the skill level of the weaker writers.</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the Draft: Authors should provide feedback on the other sections. The foremost concern should be that each section contributes to the whole. Other matters for attention include depth, clarity, organization, transitions, redundancies, and consistency among the sections. Sentence style, grammar, punctuation, spelling, and mechanics should be secondary at this point. Authors should then revise their sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the Second Draft: Everyone should read the second draft and give any additional feedback. Each of the writers should make final revisions and review his or her section for concise and clear writing style, logical organization of paragraphs, and correctness.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit and Correct the Final Draft: As a last step, one person should review the entire document for consistency in and transitions between sections as well as style, organization of paragraphs, correctness, headings, and source citations.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“Technology can facilitate the writing process. Numerous web services allow you to post a document in the cloud, edit it, add comments, and monitor versions. A team needs to be careful about setting up rules for access to and editing of the document. Many people editing the same document can lead to confusion. Most of the online services have editing tools that keep track of changes. Nevertheless, a team member should coordinate online work, setting deadlines for document changes, controlling versions, and protecting the final version from further editing.”</strong></p></li>
