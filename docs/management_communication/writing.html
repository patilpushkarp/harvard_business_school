<li><p><strong>“Globalization has added to the demand for business writing. Work teams are often scattered throughout the world. Members may rarely or never meet face to face. Due to time differences and other obstacles, much of their communication is written. Writing skills now play a central role in how well people work together.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Although English has become the common language of international business, differences in the cultural norms of audiences complicate communication across borders. A written report that seems laborious and overly formal to members of a global team in one country may strike team members from another country as well paced and respectful.

<li><p>Information sources are, but not limited to, physical documents, company intranet, online databases, and the web.</p></li>

Everyone in business experiences some degree of information overload. To limit it when writing, use purpose and audience to set boundaries on the information you need for a message.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Notes can be used for more than recording information. They can be a dialog with your material. You can write down questions you need to answer with research or in the message you will write.

<h4>Writing the draft<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-the-draft" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Here are practices that can make drafting more productive and efficient.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You don’t have to begin at the beginning. - You don’t have to write each section in the order in which it appears in your writing plan. Write what you know, wherever it belongs in the plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t worry about the small stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Correctness and sentence style come later. Turn off the grammar checker. It gets in the way of thinking. Also, most grammar checkers are wrong more often than not. Turn off the spell checker. It’s also a distraction that interrupts thought.</p></li>
<li><p>Grab thoughts in any form. - Capture your thoughts even if they don’t present themselves in complete sentences. When you need a piece of information but know what you want to say about it, don’t interrupt yourself to look for it. You can insert it later.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t stick with a bad plan. - If your writing plan isn’t working, stop and rework the plan. Don’t try to write yourself out of a poor plan.</p></li>

<h4>Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#correctness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This is the final stage for making the content audience-ready.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Errors in a written message force readers to perform a fix-up, the process of mentally stopping to correct a mistake and thus understanding the meaning of words or sentences. Each fix-up diverts the reader from the process of building meaning from the message. A large number of fix-ups destroys the coherence of a message.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Correctness also gives you credibility.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Use a grammar checker as a guide, and carefully read for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Turn on the spell checker, but don’t rely on it completely. Proofread your writing to identify spelling errors and mistakes in word usage that the spell checker misses.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Consider these suggestions for correcting a document:”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look for words you frequently misspell. - Use the Find and Replace function in a word-processing program. Type misspellings in the search box and see if they occur anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for “personal” grammatical mistakes. - Do you make the same grammar mistakes frequently? Search for them, using the Find and Replace function.</p></li>
<li><p>Use online resources. - For quick answers about grammar, punctuation, and mechanics such as capitalization, use online resources. One of the best is The Owl, a free site developed by Purdue University.</p></li>
<li><p>Concentrate on proofreading. - You may start editing sentences instead of reading them for correctness, making the process longer and potentially missing errors. One trick for avoiding this is to proofread from the end of the document and move backward paragraph by paragraph. Another approach is to underline sentences you want to edit and continue proofreading. You can edit the underlined sentences later.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“In this course, good writing is defined in relation to audiences using American English, in part because it serves as the common language of international business. When using English, however, you may have to adapt it to local audiences.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Basic needs of audiences changes depending on their culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“The contrasts between low-context and high-context cultures have special significance for written communication. Low-context cultures, like those in North America and Europe, tend to value individualism, logic, and action. High-context cultures, like those in Asia, tend to value group membership, personal relationships, and the preservation of consensus. In low-context cultures, readers want authors to state explicitly what they think, to prove it, and to contribute to getting things done. Low-context writing tends to be direct, assertive, and concise. In high-context cultures, readers expect authors to imply much of their meaning, to defer to the group, and to foster consensus. High-context writing tends to be oblique, deferential, and circuitous. One style isn’t superior to the other because each serves the norms and needs of distinct audiences.”</strong></p></li>

But repeated use of emphasis (for example, bold or italic) in the text of a business document is not a good idea for two reasons.
