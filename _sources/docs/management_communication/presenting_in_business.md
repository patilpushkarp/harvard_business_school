## Introduction

- Talking is the primary medium of presentation.
- **"A presentation consists of a set of ideas spoken to an audience. The ideas are prepared in advance along with supporting material such as slides."**
- **"By some estimates, 30,000,000 PowerPoint slides are displayed per day."**

### Leading People

- Leaders persuade to motivate people, to align them with organizational goals, and to have them accept new ideas and practices to collaborate and cooperate effectively. 

### Resolving Differences of Opinion

- Employee may disagree about business issues. 
- **"Leaders and managers need to be able to probe, question, and negotiate, but they also need to know how to use persuasion to resolve differences of opinion."**

## Obstacles to Persuasive Presentation

- Following are the obstacles for persuasive presentation:
  - Fear of speaking
  - Overreliance on slides
  - A failure to engage
  - A misconception about persuasion

### Fear of Speaking

- **"Communication apprehension (fear of public speaking) is normal, but it can be a problem when it is intense and chronic. There is even a medical term for extreme cases: glossophobia."**
- **"Being the focus of attention in a room and having sole responsibility for making something happen can stimulate fear. The fear creates a vicious circle. You fear speaking and avoid it, but the more you avoid it, the more you fear it—and the less likely you are to acquire the skills you need that will help reduce the fear."**
- Nervousness is a natural stimulant that enhances performance.
- Fear of speaking is manageable and certain techniques are available to limit it's negative effects.

### Overreliance on Slides

- **"Quite a few speakers have come to regard slides as the presentation, not as a complement to the presentation. And when the attitude that “more is better” encounters feature-rich presentation software, speakers can saturate audiences with information: slide after slide of bullet points, charts, tables, and graphs filled with so much content and formatting clutter that they are unreadable. Slides that convey too much create a dilemma for audience members."**
- Most audiences try to read the slide text or listen to the presenter simutaneously, splitting their attention and lessening the amount of information they can take in.
- **"Presenters can unwittingly use PowerPoint as a means of coping with stage fright. Slides can shift attention away from them. No longer are they speakers connecting with an audience; they are narrators of a slideshow. Even their posture can protect them from contact with the audience. To read the slides, they turn their backs to the listeners."**
- **"Most business audiences have sat through scores of presentations in school and on the job, and the odds are that many of them were boring and delivered too much information. Presentation fatigue is therefore a characteristic of business audiences. Very quickly, audience members can enter a state of minimal attention—a habit formed from many disappointing experiences."**
- Making better use of presentation tools is one solution to "death by PowerPoint".

### The Realities of Attention

- Average adult can concentrate for less than a minute.
- **"The external environment teems with distractions, and a constant stream of thoughts, emotions, memories, data from the senses, and other physical sensations flows through your mind."**
- **"Presenting isn’t about seizing and holding people’s attention continuously for long periods. Presenters must constantly reengage the audience."**

#### Managing Distraction

- Human have three capacity for attention:
  - Alerting: Awareness of one's surroundings, particularly changes in them.
  - Orienting: Attention that allows one to concentrate on something. Also called focus.
  - Executive attention: Attention that helps one to plan and make judgments.
- **"As a presenter you have to accept the reality of distractions and realize you compete with many other stimuli in the environment. The challenge is to stand out from the background noise. The most robust source of engagement and reengagement is not PowerPoint or other media. It is you and your engagement with people in the audience."**

### Misconception About Persuasion

- **"Much writing about persuasion emphasizes winning."**
- Misconception: Persuasion always involves a degree of competition. 

#### Persuasion as Collaboration

- **"You can be a better communicator by thinking of persuasion as collaborating with the audience to accomplish goals that neither party can secure entirely on their own. Defining persuasion in terms of winning or losing can limit your thinking and thwart positive outcomes."**

#### The Dark Side of Winning

- **"The idea that persuasion is about winning or losing has a potential dark side. To win, people can believe that the end justifies the means and take shortcuts such as manipulation, deception, and outright lies."**
- **"The unethical use of persuasion seems to have a natural limit."**

## Analyzing a Communication Situation

- **"Analyzing a communication situation includes understanding the purpose of a presentation and audience characteristics relevant to it, and then using the resources of reason, emotion, and character to create the message. What you learn from the analysis informs both the message—the content of the presentation—and the delivery—the manner in which you communicate it to the audience."**

### Persuasive Presentation

- Persuasive presentation is about the audience.
- **"When communicators persuade, they want something from their audiences—to adopt a desired belief or an attitude, to gain their consent or support. Presenters preoccupied with themselves—their own thoughts and feelings—lose sight of the fact that to satisfy their needs they must satisfy the audience’s needs."**
- "What is in it for the audience?" is the first question that needs to be solved.

### Arguments and Persuasive Presentations

- **"Arguments in a presentation need to be efficient. In business, presenters have a tendency to flood the audience with data and other information. But the more-is-better approach completely ignores the needs of the audience. Speakers, guided by the less-is-more principle, must make hard choices about the content of their arguments."**

### Emotions and Persuasive Presentations

- **"In a persuasive presentation, the communicator wants to align audience members’ feelings with her purpose so that both the arguments she uses and the emotions she evokes pull the audience toward the same destination: accepting the presenter’s conclusion."**
- **"Emotions—the audience’s and yours—can be hard to understand and even harder to influence, but they have a key role in persuasion."**

### Character and Persuasive Presentations

- **"To improve your persuasion abilities, you need to learn how to shape audience members’ attitude toward you. An audience always has an attitude toward a speaker. You want to foster a favorable attitude toward you."**

#### The Halo Effect and Its Opposite

- Halo effect is beneficial for the communicator and reverse halo can be detrimental.
- **"When the audience does not know you, their first impressions can function like a halo effect. According to researchers, people make a global evaluation of a stranger in a tenth of a second. They obviously make that judgment based on very limited information: your facial expression, posture, clothes, and movement."**
- **"Studies have shown that first impressions are remarkably durable and hard to change. A positive first impression can be a long-lasting asset for a speaker, while a negative one can be a serious liability."**

#### Facing a Hostile Audience

- **"Provocative audience members can lead you to responses that sour the attitudes of all audience members toward you."**
- **"Try to keep in mind that negative feelings toward someone in the audience will distract you from what you are there for: to address everyone in the room, not spar with one member. You may not be able to persuade everyone. Do your best, but you should not halt your presentation to try to convince one person."**
- **Practical suggestions for responding to hostile audience behavior:"**
  - Disagreement: Someone interrupts you to dispute what you are saying. If the person has a legitimate point, acknowledge it (for example, “You have a point and thanks for sharing it”) and resume your presentation. When you think the objection is not valid, acknowledge it by saying something innocuous (for example, “That is an interesting point”) and move on.
  - Interruptions: An individual either starts talking and will not stop or frequently interrupts. Ask the person to talk to you after the presentation. If that does not solve the problem, say something like: “I want everyone to hear my ideas and decide for themselves whether they make sense. I’d like you to listen to the rest of my presentation and then we can talk afterward.”
  - Arguments: An audience member becomes argumentative. Grant her the right to an opinion, recognize the difference between the two of you, and move on. If the individual persists in arguing, try the approach described in the previous suggestion.
  - Side Conversation: Two people in the audience talk to each other during your presentation. Ignore brief conversations, but when individuals persist in talking, walk toward them and make and hold eye contact.

## The Message: Organizing the Content

- **"The ICAA organizer, or template, stands for Issue-Conclusion-Argument-Action. It is designed for persuasive presentations and provides a shortcut for creating ideas and arranging them."**
- Components of ICAA:
  - Issue: The issue needs resolution and you should be able to express it in one or two sentences. Stating it as a question can often be helpful to the audience.
  - Conclusion: The conclusion is your answer regarding the issue. You should be able to state it in one or a few sentences.
  - Argument: The argument consists of the reasoning and evidence that back up the conclusion.
  - Action: The action portion of the presentation specifies how to implement the conclusion. It corresponds to a written action plan, except that it is not as detailed. You can offer the audience a written plan as a handout.

### Why Not Start with PowerPoint?

- **"Note that the development of a presentation begins with creating and organizing ideas, not with PowerPoint or other presentation software."**
- **"When used well, slides visually reinforce the essential ideas of a presentation. A presentation begun in PowerPoint starts with the reinforcement rather than the ideas and fosters the view that the slides are the presentation. That view may encourage a presenter to build a large slide deck crammed with information. And it may undercut a presenter’s motivation to engage with the people in the room."**
- **"A large body of research demonstrates that people learn more through a combination of sight and hearing than through one or the other alone. Slides therefore have an essential function as a learning channel parallel to speech—but not superior to it."**

### Putting the Conclusion Last

- **"In some cultures, speakers are expected to reveal their thinking gradually and defer a conclusion until the end or imply a conclusion but never state it in so many words."**
- **"Presenters can also employ the conclusion-last organization as an inductive approach to proof:"**
  - Issue: First, they state the issue.
  - Argument: Second, they argue against the major opposing opinions.
  - Argument: Third, they argue for their conclusion.
  - Conclusion: Fourth, they state the conclusion.
  - Action: Finally, they discuss actions based on the conclusion.
- **"If you decide to put your conclusion at the end of a presentation, the essential content of the argument remains the same as the conclusion-first presentation. However, The ICAA organizer has a slightly different order."**

### How Much Evidence?

- **"Business presenters often immerse audiences in large bodies of data. However, an oral presentation, even one that uses visuals, is not an effective medium for large amounts of data."**
- **"An orally delivered argument still requires proof, just as one in writing does."**
- Amount of evidence required depends on the audience.

### Openings

- A real-world audience can refuse whatever you are asking of them.
- **"For the content of the opening, ask what you think the audience most wants to talk about, the most common question they have in mind, or the most serious reservation they have about your topic."**
- **"At some point in the opening of the presentation, you should also state the issue and your conclusion and furnish a simple roadmap of the presentation—the major points of interest on the trip to the destination."**

### Closings

- **"At the end of the presentation, leave the audience with a concise memory of the points you most want them to remember. A visual can be used for this purpose. A striking image, a brief story, and an emotional appeal connected to the key points are just a few ways to fix your core message in the listeners’ memories."**
- **"Speaking past the scheduled end of the presentation violates an implicit contract with audience members. The speaker agreed to a presentation of a certain length and the audience members planned accordingly; then the speaker changes the contract without their consent. Audiences do not appreciate a speaker unwilling to let go of them."**
