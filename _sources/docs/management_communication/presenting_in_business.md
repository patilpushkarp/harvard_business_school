## Introduction

- Talking is the primary medium of presentation.
- **"A presentation consists of a set of ideas spoken to an audience. The ideas are prepared in advance along with supporting material such as slides."**
- **"By some estimates, 30,000,000 PowerPoint slides are displayed per day."**

### Leading People

- Leaders persuade to motivate people, to align them with organizational goals, and to have them accept new ideas and practices to collaborate and cooperate effectively. 

### Resolving Differences of Opinion

- Employee may disagree about business issues. 
- **"Leaders and managers need to be able to probe, question, and negotiate, but they also need to know how to use persuasion to resolve differences of opinion."**

## Obstacles to Persuasive Presentation

- Following are the obstacles for persuasive presentation:
  - Fear of speaking
  - Overreliance on slides
  - A failure to engage
  - A misconception about persuasion

### Fear of Speaking

- **"Communication apprehension (fear of public speaking) is normal, but it can be a problem when it is intense and chronic. There is even a medical term for extreme cases: glossophobia."**
- **"Being the focus of attention in a room and having sole responsibility for making something happen can stimulate fear. The fear creates a vicious circle. You fear speaking and avoid it, but the more you avoid it, the more you fear it—and the less likely you are to acquire the skills you need that will help reduce the fear."**
- Nervousness is a natural stimulant that enhances performance.
- Fear of speaking is manageable and certain techniques are available to limit it's negative effects.

### Overreliance on Slides

- **"Quite a few speakers have come to regard slides as the presentation, not as a complement to the presentation. And when the attitude that “more is better” encounters feature-rich presentation software, speakers can saturate audiences with information: slide after slide of bullet points, charts, tables, and graphs filled with so much content and formatting clutter that they are unreadable. Slides that convey too much create a dilemma for audience members."**
- Most audiences try to read the slide text or listen to the presenter simutaneously, splitting their attention and lessening the amount of information they can take in.
- **"Presenters can unwittingly use PowerPoint as a means of coping with stage fright. Slides can shift attention away from them. No longer are they speakers connecting with an audience; they are narrators of a slideshow. Even their posture can protect them from contact with the audience. To read the slides, they turn their backs to the listeners."**
- **"Most business audiences have sat through scores of presentations in school and on the job, and the odds are that many of them were boring and delivered too much information. Presentation fatigue is therefore a characteristic of business audiences. Very quickly, audience members can enter a state of minimal attention—a habit formed from many disappointing experiences."**
- Making better use of presentation tools is one solution to "death by PowerPoint".

### The Realities of Attention

- Average adult can concentrate for less than a minute.
- **"The external environment teems with distractions, and a constant stream of thoughts, emotions, memories, data from the senses, and other physical sensations flows through your mind."**
- **"Presenting isn’t about seizing and holding people’s attention continuously for long periods. Presenters must constantly reengage the audience."**

#### Managing Distraction

- Human have three capacity for attention:
  - Alerting: Awareness of one's surroundings, particularly changes in them.
  - Orienting: Attention that allows one to concentrate on something. Also called focus.
  - Executive attention: Attention that helps one to plan and make judgments.
- **"As a presenter you have to accept the reality of distractions and realize you compete with many other stimuli in the environment. The challenge is to stand out from the background noise. The most robust source of engagement and reengagement is not PowerPoint or other media. It is you and your engagement with people in the audience."**

### Misconception About Persuasion

- **"Much writing about persuasion emphasizes winning."**
- Misconception: Persuasion always involves a degree of competition. 

#### Persuasion as Collaboration

- **"You can be a better communicator by thinking of persuasion as collaborating with the audience to accomplish goals that neither party can secure entirely on their own. Defining persuasion in terms of winning or losing can limit your thinking and thwart positive outcomes."**

#### The Dark Side of Winning

- **"The idea that persuasion is about winning or losing has a potential dark side. To win, people can believe that the end justifies the means and take shortcuts such as manipulation, deception, and outright lies."**
- **"The unethical use of persuasion seems to have a natural limit."**
