# Writing in Business

```{epigraph}
Writing skills are fundamental in business. It’s increasingly important to be able to convey content in a tight, logical, direct manner, particularly in a fast-paced technological environment.

## Introduction

- **"According to a survey of large U.S. companies, the jobs of two-thirds of management-level employees include significant writing such as emails, presentations, technical reports, formal reports, and memos."**
- **"Eighty percent or more of companies in the financial sector (including insurance and real estate) and a slightly smaller percentage in the rest of the service industry consider writing in their hiring decisions."**
- More time is spent on writing than realized.

### Writing is becoming more Important

- Even the modern digital media rely more on old-fashined writing.
- **"Globalization has added to the demand for business writing. Work teams are often scattered throughout the world. Members may rarely or never meet face to face. Due to time differences and other obstacles, much of their communication is written. Writing skills now play a central role in how well people work together."**
- **"Although English has become the common language of international business, differences in the cultural norms of audiences complicate communication across borders. A written report that seems laborious and overly formal to members of a global team in one country may strike team members from another country as well paced and respectful. Communication skills must incorporate some awareness of cultural differences."**

### Writing Clarifies and Preserves Thinking

- **"The transcript of a spontaneous conversation typically contains many verbal stumbles, pauses, false starts, gaps in logic, unfinished thoughts, and unexplained references."**
- **"Oral speech isn't well suited for communicating large quantities of information or extended thinking on a complicated topic."**
- Writing helps preserve thinking.

## The Writing Process

- We don't have the same capacity for speaking and writing. Writing is usually difficult. Writing takes more effort than speaking.
- **"Some research on workplace writing indicates that experienced writers use a conscious process for writing while inexperienced writers don't. The difference is apparent in the finished products."**
- Writing process can be a practical tool for managers.
- Every writer has unique writing process.
- More attention is required on how to write instead of what to write.
- Experienced writers considers the writing process with four major steps:
  1. Preparing
  2. Drafting
  3. Revising
  4. Editing and Correcting
- The above steps may not follow the same sequence always.

### Preparing

- **"Preparing consists of doing research (if necessary), defining your purpose, understanding the audience, and organizing your thinking in a writing plan. The product of preparing is a writing plan you can follow for the first draft."**
- To not get overwhelmed by the writing process, plan first about what needs to be communicated.

#### Research and Notes

- Preparation involves researching over the topic and taking necessary notes.
- Information sources are, but not limited to, physical documents, company intranet, online databases, and the web.
- **"The information can provide compelling evidence for an argument, but it can also lead to information overload that paralyzes thought. Everyone in business experiences some degree of information overload. To limit it when writing, use purpose and audience to set boundaries on the information you need for a message."**
- **"Notes can be used for more than recording information. They can be a dialog with your material. You can write down questions you need to answer with research or in the message you will write. You can capture points to include in the writing and begin to map out an organization."**

#### Plagiarism

- **"Plagiarism occurs when “a writer deliberately uses someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source."**
- If the source is not provided and then everything in a document is considered to be the original material of the author.
- Plagiarism violates trust with the audience and do a real damage to an communicators' reputation.
- **"It is never acceptable to use word-for-word content from another source without using quotation marks and a source note. Paraphrasing content or using specific information or data from another source requires a source note."**

#### Generating Ideas

- **"Two of the best ways to think of ideas for the writing plan are asking questions and talking to people."**
- The Checklist: Analyzing a Communication Situation provides all of these questions to help you generate ideas.
- **"Content can come from people who have knowledge you can use, who have communicated on the same topic, and who have received similar information in the past."**
- **"Be opportunistic in your search for content relevant to your writing. A reference in an online article, a tweet, or a colleague's casual remark could lead to high-value content."**

#### Organizing Ideas in a Writing Plan

- Organize the content in a logical structure by grouping similar points together and arranging in a suitable order.
- **"Grouping makes the leap from discrete ideas to organized thought. As material is sorted by similarity, relationships among the groups emerge. These relationships help you define a logical order."**
- Format of the plan can be as simple as bullet points or something like mind map. The format does not matter, use whatever works for you.

### Drafting

- **"In the drafting stage, you compose your thoughts in words, sentences, and paragraphs. The goal of drafting is to write a message that expresses your thinking but isn't necessarily audience-ready, meaning that the draft can have faults and mistakes such gaps in logic or evidence."**

#### Need for Speed

- Writing speed has a limit which is based on the speed of your hand unlike brain which can do it's job of thinking at a much faster rate. This can make us lose some of our thoughts while writing.
- Ignore the perfiontionism. Don't stop for correcting the mistakes in styles.

#### Why revising helps drafting

- **"During the revision stage, you take a step back and work with the draft to improve its organization, content, and anything that compromises readability such as sentence fragments or ambiguous statements."**
- First draft will always be imperfect and no concern should contraint the process of capturing our thinking.

#### Writing the draft

- **Here are practices that can make drafting more productive and efficient.**
  - You don't have to begin at the beginning. - You don't have to write each section in the order in which it appears in your writing plan. Write what you know, wherever it belongs in the plan.
  - Don't worry about the small stuff.
  - Correctness and sentence style come later. Turn off the grammar checker. It gets in the way of thinking. Also, most grammar checkers are wrong more often than not. Turn off the spell checker. It's also a distraction that interrupts thought.
  - Grab thoughts in any form. - Capture your thoughts even if they don’t present themselves in complete sentences. When you need a piece of information but know what you want to say about it, don’t interrupt yourself to look for it. You can insert it later.
  - Don't stick with a bad plan. - If your writing plan isn't working, stop and rework the plan. Don't try to write yourself out of a poor plan.

### Revising

- Revising is the stage where the draft is reviewed carefully by focusing on the content and the organization.
- Things that can be ignored in this stage - writing style, tone and mistakes such as faulty grammer.
- **"The goal of revising is to make the substantive changes that are necessary to achieve your purpose."**
- **"There are two keys to this stage:**
  - **Reading the draft from the audience's point of view**
  - **Making necessary changes even if they are major"**

#### Reading as the Audience Would

- **"Once you have a first draft, shift to the audience's point of view."**
- The following revision questions ask you to think about the draft from the audience's point of view.
  - Have I included all of the content necessary for my purpose?
  - Is the length and amount of detail appropriate for the purpose and the audience?
  - Are there any gaps or redundancies in the content?
  - Can my readers easily follow the logic of the writing?
  - Are the sentences of each paragraph in a logical order?
  - Is my tone appropriate to the audience and occasion?
- **"To make sure you have focused on your key points, ask yourself this question: What would I say if I had only 60 seconds to get my point across to the audience? The answer to this question tells you what has to be included and what may not be necessary."**

#### What if the Draft doesn't work?

- There is a huge posiibility that we might change our mind while writing the draft.
- When we change of our mind, we are essentially changing the purpose and thus writing plan has to be changed accordingly. Do not hesitate to go back to preparing stage.

#### Feedback from others

- Never be completely objective about your own writing.
- Exercise displine and courage to commit time for major revisions.
- **"To compensate for your lack of objectivity, request feedback from others."**
- **"A reader can serve as a representative of your audience. He or she can confirm whether your writing works and isolate sections where revisions might be needed."**

### Editing and Correcting

- **"In the editing and correcting stage, review the draft for tone; sentence style; and correct grammar, spelling, and other mechanical issues such as consistent treatment of numbers. Editing consists of making your sentences as easy to read as possible and adjusting the tone without losing any essential meaning. The goal of correcting is to fix mistakes in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other writing mechanics."**

#### Editing

- Sectence is the target of editing.
- At this stage in the process, ask yourself these questions:
  - Can my reader easily understand my sentences?
  - Is the writing style considerate of the reader? (Is it clear and economical?)
  - Is the tone suitable for the purpose, audience, and topic?

#### Correctness

- This is the final stage for making the content audience-ready.
- **"Errors in a written message force readers to perform a fix-up, the process of mentally stopping to correct a mistake and thus understanding the meaning of words or sentences. Each fix-up diverts the reader from the process of building meaning from the message. A large number of fix-ups destroys the coherence of a message."**
- **"Correctness also gives you credibility."**
- **"Use a grammar checker as a guide, and carefully read for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Turn on the spell checker, but don’t rely on it completely. Proofread your writing to identify spelling errors and mistakes in word usage that the spell checker misses."**
- **"Consider these suggestions for correcting a document:"**
  - Look for words you frequently misspell. - Use the Find and Replace function in a word-processing program. Type misspellings in the search box and see if they occur anywhere.
  - Look for “personal” grammatical mistakes. - Do you make the same grammar mistakes frequently? Search for them, using the Find and Replace function.
  - Use online resources. - For quick answers about grammar, punctuation, and mechanics such as capitalization, use online resources. One of the best is The Owl, a free site developed by Purdue University.
  - Concentrate on proofreading. - You may start editing sentences instead of reading them for correctness, making the process longer and potentially missing errors. One trick for avoiding this is to proofread from the end of the document and move backward paragraph by paragraph. Another approach is to underline sentences you want to edit and continue proofreading. You can edit the underlined sentences later.

### What is good business writing?

- Differentiating qualities of good and bad business writings:

|Qualities|Good Writing|Bad Writing|
