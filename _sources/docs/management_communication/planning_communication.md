# Planning Communication

```{epigraph}
And as for purpose, don't settle for "I want my words to work." Visualize specifically what you want the words to do. Make the readers see something? Make them feel certain emotions? Perform certain actions? Change their minds?

-- Peter Elbow
```

## Introduction

- Daily communication might not require a lot of thought but it is always better to properly compose thoughts before communicating and can be more effective.
- **"Planning your communication—by analyzing the situation and organizing your message—often delivers better results than operating on instinct."**

## What Good are Models?

- Models and frameworks are used in various areas of business.
- In short term, models are memorize and applied on a specific business usecase. Source of information can be textbook, cases, simulations and similar educational materials.
- **"Learming how to apply models can embed them in our memory."**

## Analyzing a Communication situation

- Sender needs to know precise purpose or intention of the message to be sent.
- Sender need to understand the audience before the message is being sent and to fulfill the purpose.
- **"An effective communicator is a good learner."**
- Knowledge gained with thinking about purpose and audience can enhance the message. 
- There is always to know more about the audience even if they work with us.
  
### Three questions for Analyzing a Situation

|Question|Purpose|
|:--:|:--|
|Why|What is it that needs to accomplished by communication|
|Who|People with whom communication will be taking place|
|How|The content that needs to be communicated|

[Checklist: Analyzing a Communication Situation](Checklist_Analyzing-Comm-Situation.pdf)

### Why? Knowing your purpose

- This question is used to identify the purpose of communication or the outcome that needs to achieved through communication.
- In business, managers communicate to for the following reasons
  - To transfer information or to inform
  - To motivate the audience to change their opinion or to take actions.

#### The Purpose of Informing

- **"Informative communication - Communication that describes or explains some aspect of reality."**
- This type of communication is generally used to name a method or process and explain the purpose or utility of the same.

#### The Purpose of Persuading

- **"persuasion - The use of language to motivate an audience to think, feel, or act in the way the communicator intends."**

|Persuasive Communication|Purpose|
|:--:|:--|
|Conference call with stock market analysts|Think: Motivate investors to think the company is a sound investment.|
|CEO at an annual shareholders meeting|Feel: Motivate shareholders to feel confidence in a new CEO.|
|Video presentation to employees|Act: Motivate employees to act in a specific way, such as to sign up for a fitness program.|
|Presentation to CEO|Think, feel, and act: Convince the CEO to think that the company's strategy is flawed, to feel doubt about it, and to authorize a team to propose changes.|

- Good communication is essential for influential leadership as it is the only way to succeed in the long term. Leader should be able to persuade and treat people as partners and collaborators.
- Clients don't want to be told what to do. They want choices, decision points and collaborators.

#### Getting Things Done with Persuasion

- Persuasion is the language of business leadership. It is used to get work done and for achieving the desired outcomes with everyone.

|Persuasion|Catalyst for Work|Outcome You Can't Realize on Your Own|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Sales presentation|Selling online video services|Selling in the United States, Latin America, and Asia|

- Persuasion should be used daily.
- Persuasion ensures that people share the same goals and worked cooperatively.
- Alternatives to persuasion, authoritarianism or anarchy, are sever drawbacks.
- Persuasion usually don't succeed on the first try.
- Business persuasion is a process and not an event, requiring multiple communications and other influences. **" In the process, the initial purpose can change as audience members ask questions, raise objections, and put forward their own ideas."**
- Persuasion can stimulate diverse viewpoints which has the capability to improve the end result.
- Two questions to help define purpose:

|Informative|Persuasive|
|:--:|:--:|
|What is the importance of the information?|What is the importance of the topic?|
|What specific information gap do I want to fill?|What do I want the audience to think, feel, and do?|

- Clarifying the purpose is essential for the communication.

### Who? Knowing your audience

- Communication is all about the audience.
- **"Understanding your audience will help you achieve the purpose you have defined."**
- Only the information which will be helpful for fulfilling the purpose is required about the audience.
- **"Before you start creating the content of a written or spoken message, take ten minutes to think only about your audience. Record the points that seem most worthwhile. As soon as you can, compare your perceptions of the audience with those of someone trustworthy who knows some or all of the audience members. The odds are very high that what you learn will affect what and how you communicate."**
- **"Apologies tend to placate people and make them receptive."**
- To explore your audience, these questions are helpful:
  - Who is my audience?
  - What do my audience members know about the topic?
  - What is their attitude toward the topic? Do they have any biases related to the topic?
  - What is their attitude toward me?
  - What is my attitude toward the audience?

#### Primary and Secondary Audiences

- Identify whether you have more than one audience.
- Focus on the primary audience than on the secondary audience.

#### Barriers to Communication

- Identify the barriers in order to remove them or the lessen their impact.
- In business, there are many potential barriers to communication:
  - Hostility to the conclusion, the communicator, or both
  - Audience belief that the writer or speaker isn't trustworthy
  - Lack of background knowledge in the writer-speaker or the audience
  - Bias in the speaker-writer or in the audience
  - Ethical and legal issues related to the topic
  - Power and other organizational issues, such as a speaker addressing an audience over whom he or she has no power but nevertheless seeks action from
  - Cultural factors such as different attitudes toward conflict in the presenter and the audience
  - Language issues, such as the inability of audience members to follow someone speaking too fast in their second language

- **Learn to be flexible with the communication styles across cusltures.**
- **Some cultures place a high value on developing personal relationships as well as business relationships; others don’t. If not acknowledged, the difference can cause problems.**
- **Cultures often have conflicting norms for punctuality. Even digital communication can be affected by the differences.**
- **Gender roles can be influential, regardless of the communication medium. But digital media may make it less of an issue.**
- **Age shouldn’t have a large impact on any type of digital communication.**
- **Likes and dislikes in entertainment can cement relationships in any medium, but they shouldn’t be a major barrier in email and other digital media.**
- **Desire for effifcient communication can be a high barrier if, for cultural reasons, one party expects concise messages and the other party writes longer messages with more context and some content not strictly related to business.**

### Cognitive Bias

- Humans are biased in their thinking.
- Bias can affect communication in two ways:
  - Our own bias may influence message
  - Bias at the reception by audience
- **"ias has relevance for communication because it can lead to distorted views of a situation, tension between the communicator and the audience, and misunderstandings."**
- Four biases which has significant impact on coomunication:
  1. False generalization
  2. Anchoring bias
  3. Availability bias
  4. Representativeness bias

#### False Generalization

- **"False generalization, also called the law of small numbers, means drawing a conclusion from a small set of data; the resulting conclusion is often wrong."**
- **"Arises from our need to believe that the world is orderly and consistent"**
  
#### Dealing with False Generalization

- Considering a larger set of may help us avoid false generalization.

#### Anchoring Bias

- **"Anchoring bias (or simply anchoring) is excessive reliance on one or a few values, particularly when judging, deciding, or acting. In other words, one or a few values have unjustified influence over judgment, decision making, or action."**

#### Dealing with Anchoring Bias

- Anchoring bias can be avoided by setting setting appropriate and realistic reference points.
- Examination of reference points and benchmarks is important of oneself and the target audience.
  
#### Availability Bias

- **"bias is the tendency to base a judgment or decision on the ease with which a relevant fact or event can be recalled. Often recency plays a major role; it's easier to recall an event that just happened than one that happened at an earlier time."**

#### Dealing with Availability Bias

- **"Base rate - The probability of something being determined by rational means, such as statistics."**
- Availability biases can be dealt by building arguments around the base rates.

#### Representativeness Bias

- **"Representativeness bias allows people to judge whether something belongs in a specific category according to characteristics that they believe represent members of the category."**

#### Dealing with Representativeness Bias

- **"To spur your awareness of representativeness bias, ask yourself whether a classification you have made reflects all the relevant factors. In persuasive forms of communication, concentrate on classifications vital to your argument."**

### How? Choosing a Channel

- Number of options to communication have increased significantly and have increased the ability to collaborate, innovate and mentor over long distances thereby linking people across the organization.
- A very little thought is given to the communication channel.
- Think about the channel before communicating.

#### Questions about Channels

- Here are questions that can assist you in selecting a channel:
  - Which channel is best for my purpose?
  - Which channel is best for my audience?
  - Which channel is best for conveying information or making an argument?
  - Which channel is best for making an emotional impact on my audience?
  - Which channel is best for me?

### How? Using Reasoning in the Message

- Reasoning is always reliable in business. Irrational thinking will always be disastrous for any busniess.
- **"Reason is the most fundamental tool for creating business communication. Workplace audiences expect the content of presentations, memos, emails, and other forms of communication to be well reasoned and logical."**

#### Informative Communication

- Reason is used to select the information of greatest value for the audience. Omission of non-relevant information is the hardest part.
- We cannot use all the informtion that is available in ones lifetime.
- More information may not always help audience to be better informed. It may lead to confusion, tireness and unreceptiveness.
- Information to be communicated should always be selected based on the principle of need to rather than nice to know.
- **"reason is used in informative communication to build a logical organization that helps the audience understand the content."**
- **"Communicating information that the audience won't remember is pointless."**
- Using reason in an informative message primarily has to do with selecting and ordering information by answering two questions:
  - What information does the audience need to know to fulfill my purpose?
  - What is the most logical way of presenting the information?

#### Persuasive Comunication

- Business audiences expect persuasion to be rational rather than emotional.
- Persuasion is a skillful activity.

#### Using Arguments

- **" Argument is reaching a conclusion by using evidence. Evidence comprises qualitative and quantitative facts, calculations, inferences, theoretical knowledge, personal experience, and expert opinion."**
![Using Arguments](./using_arguments.png)
- **"A concise evidence statement, combined with the conclusion, can be an excellent opening for a presentation or a written communication."**

#### Using Assumptions

- **"Induction is the process of concluding that something is probably true based on relevant observations. Deduction is the process of concluding that something is probably true by reference to a principle that is generally accepted as true."**
- Induction and deductions both cannot be used directly for real-world arguments. 
- **"Deductive logic, however, is based on a concept of great value for real-world reasoning. Deduction works because a generally accepted principle justifies related statements. In deduction, the generally accepted principle is called a major premise or an assumption."**
- **"The assumption makes the conclusion possible by connecting the evidence and the conclusion."**
- To check assumption of an argument - 

|What to do|How to do to|
|:--|:--|
|Define the assumption.|Determine the logical link between the evidence and conclusion.|
|Evaluate the assumption's acceptability to the audience.|Decide whether the intended audience will believe the assumption.|
|Use the argument or change it.|If the assumption is acceptable, use the argument. If the assumption is not acceptable, change the argument.|

- **"Judging the acceptability of assumptions depends on the audience and all the variables that affect it, such as culture, values, history, bias, and knowledge."** Hence know your audience.
- Assumptions should be acceptable to the audience.

#### Three Questions for Creating Arguments

- The following questions are useful for constructing an argument:
  - What arguments can I make to achieve my purpose?
  - What evidence do I have or need to support the arguments?
  - What assumptions am I making? Are they acceptable to the audience?

### How? Using Emotion in the Message

- Emotion influences our every thought and action.
- **"Emotion is generally not an essential factor in informative communication, but it matters a great deal in persuasion. Emotion influences how an audience reacts to a communication. It also influences how writers and speakers express themselves in their messages."**
