# Revenue and Receivables

## Unredeemed Gift Certificate

- The gift certificate when not redeemed by the customer should not be included in the sales revenue totals as it satisfies the realization criteria but not the earned criteria.
- This unredeemed gift certificate should be recorded in deferred revenue account. 
- **"Deferred revenue is future revenue that has already been collected but has yet to be earned. It is shown in the liabilities section of the balance sheet."**
- Other examples of deferred or unearned revenue include: magazine subscriptions sold by publishers sometimes a year or more in advance of delivering the magazines, advance sales of airline tickets or theatre and sporting events, sales of coupon for future services such as free upgrades on computer software.
- **"The sale of gift certificate and other similar revenue sales transaction must remain on the balance sheet and cannot go into the income statement as revenue until it is both earned and realized."**
- Once the revenue is realized, then deferred account is debited and sales account is credited. 

## Bad Debt

### Estimation

- Allowance account can be used for bad debts.
- **"The purpose of an allowance account is to record your accounts receivable at the amount you expect to receive in the future."**
- To create an allowance, entity must start by estimating the amount of in a particular period in accounts receivable that might eventually become bad debts.
- **"Based on their past experience, some companies assume that bad debts will be a constant percentage of accounts receivable. Not knowing which accounts receivable will actually not be paid, they use the percentage to calculate the allowance for bad debts."** Some companies follow another approach. They "age" their receivables - grouping them by the number of days they are overdue, since older ones are more likely to be converted to bad debts. These methods are called allowance methods. 
- There is a third approach is used for tax purposes. It is the direct write-off method. In this method, bad debt is only recognized when the related receivable goes bad.

### Allowance set up

- **"To record the bad debt expense two new accounts must be set up - the allowance for bad debts account and the bad debt expense account."**
- **"For journal entry purposes, the allowance for bad debts account is treated like a liability account."**
- **"The bad debt expense account is an income statement account."**
- Generally, bad debt expenses is rolled in to total general and administrative or operating expenses.

### Write-offs

- **"The final step is to record a bad debt write-off when it becomes clear that a particular customer cannot pay the debt."**
- The net effect on the balance sheet will be 0. There is no impact on total assets, liabilities and retained earnings.

## Refunds

- Use the allowance method used for bad debts to account for the possibility of returns

### Estimating

- **"Most companies make an estimate of the amount of their sales that will be returned based on previous experience."**

### Allowance set up

- **"To recognize the returns and accompanying refunds, you create a liability account called "Allowance for sales returns"."**
- **"The Estimated Sales Refund account balance is a deduction from gross sales. On the income statement this account is renamed and appears as 'Allowance for sales returns'. Do not let this renaming of the income statement account confuse you. The liability account of the same name is still on the balance sheet."**

### Actual Returns

- The final step is to record the actual returns.
- The allowance for refunds account appears in the end of the period financial statements as a liability account. When the refund takes place, cash is credited (a minus to an asset account) and the allowance account is debited (a minus to a liability account) thus reducing Assets and Liabilities by the same amount. The income statement and hence retained earnings would not be affected.
