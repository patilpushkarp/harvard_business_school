# Decision Analysis

## Introduction

### Introducing Decision Analysis

- **"Decision-making is an essential management responsibility. Managers are charged with choosing from multiple courses of action that can each lead to radically different consequences."**
- **"When faced with a choice of actions and a range of possible outcomes, decision making can be difficult, in large part due to uncertainty. Although the course of action we choose influences the outcome, much of what happens is not only beyond our control, but beyond our powers to predict with certainty."**
- **"Decision analysis tools can help managers weigh alternative options and make informed and rational choices."**
- **"In a world of uncertainty, applying decision analysis will not guarantee that each decision you make will lead to the best result, or even to a good result. But if you apply effective decision analysis consistently over the course of a managerial career, you are almost certain to gain a reputation for sound judgment."**

#### Summary

- **"Decision analysis is a set of formal tools that can help managers make more informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Although applying even the most rigorous decision analysis does not guarantee infallibility, it can help you make sound judgments over the course of your career."**

## Decision Trees

### Uncertainty and Probability

- **"Uncertainty clearly has a quantitative dimension: we can distinguish between degrees of uncertainty."**
- **"Probability is a measure of uncertainty."**
- **"Events that are impossible are said to have zero (or zero percent) probability, and events that are absolutely certain are said to have a probability of one (or 100%)."**
- We have a set of events and a set of outcomes. We form the ratio of the number of times a particular event occurs to the total number of experiments. The probability of that particular event is the value that ratio approaches as the total number of experiments approaches infinity.
- **"Your subjective estimate may be based on an informal assessment of relative frequency."**
- **"It makes sense to measure the uncertainty due to a lack of information the same way we measure the uncertainty due to our inability to predict the outcomes of future events."**

#### Summary

- **"Uncertainty makes decision-making challenging. We can be uncertain about outcomes that have or have not occurred. To make the most informed decisions, we quantify our uncertainty using probability measures. Probability is measured on a scale from 0% to 100%: events with 0% probability are impossible; events with 100% probability are certain. An event's probability can often be determined by observing the relative frequency of its occurrence within a set of opportunities for the event to occur. For events for which relative frequencies are difficult to assess, we often make subjective estimates of the probabilities. Though not based on "hard" data, these estimates are often a sufficient basis for sound decision making."**

### Structuring Decision Trees

- **"Graphical representations are often a highly efficient way to organize and convey information. Scatter plots and histograms efficiently communicate distributions of data, an organizational chart can quickly outline the structure of a company; and pie charts effectively express information about proportions and probabilities."**
- Decision tree: a graphical tool that helps inform and organize the decision-making process.
- **"Decisions aren't the only points at which alternatives can branch off. Events with uncertain outcomes also lead to branching alternatives. Each of the uncertain outcomes corresponds to a separate branch on the decision tree."**
- **"Decision trees have two types of branching points, or nodes. At decision nodes, the tree branches into the alternatives the decision-maker can choose. We use square boxes to represent decision nodes."**
- **"At chance nodes, the tree branches because the uncertainty of the business world permits multiple possible outcomes. We represent chance nodes by circles."**
- **"We arrange the nodes from left to right in the order in which we will eventually determine their results."**
- **"One of the challenges of creating a decision tree is determining the correct sequence of nodes: in what order will the relevant outcomes be determined? Which events "depend" on the occurrence of other events? What alternatives are created or foreclosed by prior decisions or by the outcomes of uncertain events?"**
- **"Drawing a decision tree forces us to delineate each alternative and clarify our assumptions about those alternatives. Thus, even before we use a tree to make a decision, simply structuring the tree helps us clarify and organize our thoughts about a problem. A decision tree is also useful in its own right as a tool for communicating our understanding of a complex situation to others."**
- **"Categorizing branching points as decision or chance nodes makes clear which events and outcomes are under our power and which are beyond our control."**
- **"Writing down alternatives in a systematic fashion often allows us to think of ideas for new alternatives."**

#### Summary

- **"Decision trees are a graphical tool managers use to organize, structure, and inform their decision-making. Decision trees branch at two types of nodes: at decision nodes, the branches represent different courses of action the decision-maker can choose. At chance nodes, the branches represent different possible outcomes of an uncertain event - at the time of the initial decision, the decision maker does not know which of these outcomes will occur (or has occurred). The nodes are arranged from left to right, in the order in which the decision-maker will determine which of the possible branches actually occurs."**
