# Financial Forecasting

- **"Projected financial statements are often called pro forma statements. They can help address many questions a manager might be interested in; for example, what will our financing requirements be if we grow sales at 10% next year? If we grow at 10% for each of the next five years, what will happen to earnings per share if we increase leverage? Will a recession cause us to violate a covenant on our bank loan? And so forth."**
