# Writing in Business

```{epigraph}
Writing skills are fundamental in business. It’s increasingly important to be able to convey content in a tight, logical, direct manner, particularly in a fast-paced technological environment.

```

## Introduction

- **"According to a survey of large U.S. companies, the jobs of two-thirds of management-level employees include significant writing such as emails, presentations, technical reports, formal reports, and memos."**
- **"Eighty percent or more of companies in the financial sector (including insurance and real estate) and a slightly smaller percentage in the rest of the service industry consider writing in their hiring decisions."**
- More time is spent on writing than realized.

### Writing is becoming more Important

- Even the modern digital media rely more on old-fashined writing.
- **"Globalization has added to the demand for business writing. Work teams are often scattered throughout the world. Members may rarely or never meet face to face. Due to time differences and other obstacles, much of their communication is written. Writing skills now play a central role in how well people work together."**
- **"Although English has become the common language of international business, differences in the cultural norms of audiences complicate communication across borders. A written report that seems laborious and overly formal to members of a global team in one country may strike team members from another country as well paced and respectful. Communication skills must incorporate some awareness of cultural differences."**

### Writing Clarifies and Preserves Thinking

- **"The transcript of a spontaneous conversation typically contains many verbal stumbles, pauses, false starts, gaps in logic, unfinished thoughts, and unexplained references."**
- **"Oral speech isn't well suited for communicating large quantities of information or extended thinking on a complicated topic."**
- Writing helps preserve thinking.

## The Writing Process

- We don't have the same capacity for speaking and writing. Writing is usually difficult. Writing takes more effort than speaking.
- **"Some research on workplace writing indicates that experienced writers use a conscious process for writing while inexperienced writers don't. The difference is apparent in the finished products."**
- Writing process can be a practical tool for managers.
- Every writer has unique writing process.
- More attention is required on how to write instead of what to write.
- Experienced writers considers the writing process with four major steps:
  1. Preparing
  2. Drafting
  3. Revising
  4. Editing and Correcting
- The above steps may not follow the same sequence always.

### Preparing

- **"Preparing consists of doing research (if necessary), defining your purpose, understanding the audience, and organizing your thinking in a writing plan. The product of preparing is a writing plan you can follow for the first draft."**
- To not get overwhelmed by the writing process, plan first about what needs to be communicated.

#### Research and Notes

- Preparation involves researching over the topic and taking necessary notes.
- Information sources are, but not limited to, physical documents, company intranet, online databases, and the web.
- **"The information can provide compelling evidence for an argument, but it can also lead to information overload that paralyzes thought. Everyone in business experiences some degree of information overload. To limit it when writing, use purpose and audience to set boundaries on the information you need for a message."**
- **"Notes can be used for more than recording information. They can be a dialog with your material. You can write down questions you need to answer with research or in the message you will write. You can capture points to include in the writing and begin to map out an organization."**

#### Plagiarism

- **"Plagiarism occurs when “a writer deliberately uses someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source."**
- If the source is not provided and then everything in a document is considered to be the original material of the author.
- Plagiarism violates trust with the audience and do a real damage to an communicators' reputation.
- **"It is never acceptable to use word-for-word content from another source without using quotation marks and a source note. Paraphrasing content or using specific information or data from another source requires a source note."**

#### Generating Ideas

- **"Two of the best ways to think of ideas for the writing plan are asking questions and talking to people."**
- The Checklist: Analyzing a Communication Situation provides all of these questions to help you generate ideas.
- **"Content can come from people who have knowledge you can use, who have communicated on the same topic, and who have received similar information in the past."**
- **"Be opportunistic in your search for content relevant to your writing. A reference in an online article, a tweet, or a colleague's casual remark could lead to high-value content."**

#### Organizing Ideas in a Writing Plan

- Organize the content in a logical structure by grouping similar points together and arranging in a suitable order.
- **"Grouping makes the leap from discrete ideas to organized thought. As material is sorted by similarity, relationships among the groups emerge. These relationships help you define a logical order."**
- Format of the plan can be as simple as bullet points or something like mind map. The format does not matter, use whatever works for you.

### Drafting

- **"In the drafting stage, you compose your thoughts in words, sentences, and paragraphs. The goal of drafting is to write a message that expresses your thinking but isn't necessarily audience-ready, meaning that the draft can have faults and mistakes such gaps in logic or evidence."**

#### Need for Speed

- Writing speed has a limit which is based on the speed of your hand unlike brain which can do it's job of thinking at a much faster rate. This can make us lose some of our thoughts while writing.
- Ignore the perfiontionism. Don't stop for correcting the mistakes in styles.

#### Why revising helps drafting

- **"During the revision stage, you take a step back and work with the draft to improve its organization, content, and anything that compromises readability such as sentence fragments or ambiguous statements."**
- First draft will always be imperfect and no concern should contraint the process of capturing our thinking.

#### Writing the draft

- **Here are practices that can make drafting more productive and efficient.**
  - You don't have to begin at the beginning. - You don't have to write each section in the order in which it appears in your writing plan. Write what you know, wherever it belongs in the plan.
  - Don't worry about the small stuff.
  - Correctness and sentence style come later. Turn off the grammar checker. It gets in the way of thinking. Also, most grammar checkers are wrong more often than not. Turn off the spell checker. It's also a distraction that interrupts thought.
  - Grab thoughts in any form. - Capture your thoughts even if they don’t present themselves in complete sentences. When you need a piece of information but know what you want to say about it, don’t interrupt yourself to look for it. You can insert it later.
  - Don't stick with a bad plan. - If your writing plan isn't working, stop and rework the plan. Don't try to write yourself out of a poor plan.

### Revising

- Revising is the stage where the draft is reviewed carefully by focusing on the content and the organization.
- Things that can be ignored in this stage - writing style, tone and mistakes such as faulty grammer.
- **"The goal of revising is to make the substantive changes that are necessary to achieve your purpose."**
- **"There are two keys to this stage:**
  - **Reading the draft from the audience's point of view**
  - **Making necessary changes even if they are major"**

#### Reading as the Audience Would

- **"Once you have a first draft, shift to the audience's point of view."**
- The following revision questions ask you to think about the draft from the audience's point of view.
  - Have I included all of the content necessary for my purpose?
  - Is the length and amount of detail appropriate for the purpose and the audience?
  - Are there any gaps or redundancies in the content?
  - Can my readers easily follow the logic of the writing?
  - Are the sentences of each paragraph in a logical order?
  - Is my tone appropriate to the audience and occasion?
- **"To make sure you have focused on your key points, ask yourself this question: What would I say if I had only 60 seconds to get my point across to the audience? The answer to this question tells you what has to be included and what may not be necessary."**

#### What if the Draft doesn't work?

- There is a huge posiibility that we might change our mind while writing the draft.
- When we change of our mind, we are essentially changing the purpose and thus writing plan has to be changed accordingly. Do not hesitate to go back to preparing stage.

#### Feedback from others

- Never be completely objective about your own writing.
- Exercise displine and courage to commit time for major revisions.
- **"To compensate for your lack of objectivity, request feedback from others."**
- **"A reader can serve as a representative of your audience. He or she can confirm whether your writing works and isolate sections where revisions might be needed."**

### Editing and Correcting

- **"In the editing and correcting stage, review the draft for tone; sentence style; and correct grammar, spelling, and other mechanical issues such as consistent treatment of numbers. Editing consists of making your sentences as easy to read as possible and adjusting the tone without losing any essential meaning. The goal of correcting is to fix mistakes in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other writing mechanics."**

#### Editing

- Sectence is the target of editing.
- At this stage in the process, ask yourself these questions:
  - Can my reader easily understand my sentences?
  - Is the writing style considerate of the reader? (Is it clear and economical?)
  - Is the tone suitable for the purpose, audience, and topic?

#### Correctness

- This is the final stage for making the content audience-ready.
- **"Errors in a written message force readers to perform a fix-up, the process of mentally stopping to correct a mistake and thus understanding the meaning of words or sentences. Each fix-up diverts the reader from the process of building meaning from the message. A large number of fix-ups destroys the coherence of a message."**
- **"Correctness also gives you credibility."**
- **"Use a grammar checker as a guide, and carefully read for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Turn on the spell checker, but don’t rely on it completely. Proofread your writing to identify spelling errors and mistakes in word usage that the spell checker misses."**
- **"Consider these suggestions for correcting a document:"**
  - Look for words you frequently misspell. - Use the Find and Replace function in a word-processing program. Type misspellings in the search box and see if they occur anywhere.
  - Look for “personal” grammatical mistakes. - Do you make the same grammar mistakes frequently? Search for them, using the Find and Replace function.
  - Use online resources. - For quick answers about grammar, punctuation, and mechanics such as capitalization, use online resources. One of the best is The Owl, a free site developed by Purdue University.
  - Concentrate on proofreading. - You may start editing sentences instead of reading them for correctness, making the process longer and potentially missing errors. One trick for avoiding this is to proofread from the end of the document and move backward paragraph by paragraph. Another approach is to underline sentences you want to edit and continue proofreading. You can edit the underlined sentences later.

### What is good business writing?

- Differentiating qualities of good and bad business writings:

|Qualities|Good Writing|Bad Writing|
|--|--|--|
|Time|Best use of readers’ time|Takes more time than necessary|
|Effect on audience members|Informs, structures, and stimulates their thinking|Confuses, frustrates, or antagonizes them|
|Action|Facilitates action|Blocks or leads to misguided action|

## Four Qualities of Business Writing

- **"In this course, good writing is defined in relation to audiences using American English, in part because it serves as the common language of international business. When using English, however, you may have to adapt it to local audiences."**
- Basic needs of audiences changes depending on their culture.
- **"The contrasts between low-context and high-context cultures have special significance for written communication. Low-context cultures, like those in North America and Europe, tend to value individualism, logic, and action. High-context cultures, like those in Asia, tend to value group membership, personal relationships, and the preservation of consensus. In low-context cultures, readers want authors to state explicitly what they think, to prove it, and to contribute to getting things done. Low-context writing tends to be direct, assertive, and concise. In high-context cultures, readers expect authors to imply much of their meaning, to defer to the group, and to foster consensus. High-context writing tends to be oblique, deferential, and circuitous. One style isn’t superior to the other because each serves the norms and needs of distinct audiences."**
- Characteristics such as above affect audience expectations for written communication.
- Four characteristics of good business writing

|Business Audience Need|Quality|Definition|
|--|--|--|
|Tell us your opinion.|Direct|Say what you mean|
|Respect our time.|Concise|in the fewest words possible|
|Do not make us work hard to understand you.|Clear|in a way that is easily understood|
|Present your thinking in an easy-to-follow order.|Logical|with a logical organization.|

### Direct Writing

- Stating the thoughts early in written communication is essential in direct writing. Convey the audience what they are here for.
- **"Direct writing tells the audience the answers to these two questions:"**
  - What is this about?
  - Why should I read it?
- **"The elevator pitch is an exercise in directness. An individual has 60 seconds to convince someone, for example, the CEO. With little time to speak, she can’t afford to delay the main point. If she does, the CEO will cut her off. A good question to ask when planning a written communication is: What would I say if I had only a minute to get my point across?"**

### Concise Writing

- **"Concise writing makes economical use of words. Think of words as the price the audience has to pay to understand what the writer has to say. In American business English, readers want to pay the lowest price."**
- **"Conciseness flows from respect for readers and from the knowledge that the aim of writing is to provide them with something valuable."**

#### Avoiding Verbosity and Grandiosity

- Misconception: **"Long and wordy sentences show the audience that the writer is well educated and knows what she's talking about. Verbosity = intelligence + expertise"**
- **"Good writers choose simple language when it expresses the meaning they want, using less common words and technical terms only when the meaning of those words is essential to the message."**

### Clear Writing

- Clear writing helps in seeing the meaning of the words while the unclear wiriting hinders the understanding the meaning in the communication.
- Clear writing is achieved by clearfully constructed sentences that shows specific connections between ideas.
- **"Business buzzwords, clichés, and other misuses of language disrupt clear expression because they deliver little meaning and often make sentences ambiguous."**

### Logical Writing

- **"Readers depend upon the logic of sentences to construct meaning in their brains. When sentences are not in an order that makes sense to readers, they stop and try to repair the logic. But they may not have the patience to do it and instead stop reading."**

---

## Using Visual Cues

- **"Good document design reinforces the logical organization of a message for the reader. The visual style of your message should be the same as the writing style: simple. One of the biggest mistakes business writers make is to decorate a message with too many visual devices. Their intention, to aid the reader, is good. Unfortunately, the result is a visually busy message that distracts the reader."**
- Methods providing visual cues to the reader:

|Visual Cues|Functions|
|--|--|
|Paragraphs|Makes visible major chunks of the content.|
|White space|Separates and sets off words.|
|Headings|Signal the logical divisions of a message.|
|Lists|Make multiple items easier to see and understand.|
|Type|Makes text easier to read.|

### Paragraph

- **"Paragraphs and sentences are the two fundamental units of content. A paragraph is a visual element of a message set apart through an indented first line or white space above and below it."**
- **"When readers see a paragraph, they expect it to contain related sentences about a single topic. If it doesn’t, its visual distinctness deceives the reader."**
- **"Long paragraphs are difficult for readers to process. The meaning of a message becomes easier to discern when it is broken into smaller units of meaning. A topic sentence, which summarizes the meaning common to the group of sentences making up the paragraph, also facilitates reading comprehension."**

### White Space

- White space increase the readability of a message.
- **"White space is the most common and effective method of grouping words into distinct units. White space is used between and around paragraphs, before and after headings, and around exhibits and other visuals such as charts. In your written messages, be generous with white space. A cramped, claustrophobic document design makes reading harder."**

### Headings

- **"Headings signal the logical divisions of a written message. They allow readers to skim a document before reading it and form an impression of its structure and meaning. They also serve as navigational signals as the readers work through the message. In the end, headings enhance the readers’ retention."**
- **"Keep your heading structure simple. A message with many levels and styles of headings looks complex. Generally, as text becomes more visually complex, readers become more reluctant and struggle more to comprehend it. Two or three levels of headings should be all you need."**
- **"Headings should specifically describe the content below them, but they should be very concise."**
- **"Typographically, the distinctions among levels of headings should be simple. Use fonts, boldface, italics, and capitalization to distinguish heading levels. Headings should have extra white space above and below."**

### Lists

- **"Lists serve readers by displaying a series of related items vertically instead of horizontally in a normal line of text. The technique simplifies reading and improves comprehension. Bulleted lists suit most content. Use numbered lists when the sequence of items is important, such as steps in a process."**
- **"The guidelines for using lists are as follows:"**
  - Don't overuse them.
  - Keep the lists short.
  - Keep the list items short.
  - Don't use multiple levels (except in an outline).
  - Use simple bullets to mark each item.
- **"A numbered list tells readers that the order of items is an integral part of their meaning."**

### Type

- **"Typeface is often overlooked as a visual resource."**
- **"There is some evidence that serif fonts are easier to read on printed pages, especially when the document is long. Sans serif type is used extensively on web pages because it tends to be bigger and have more space between letters than serif type."**

### Fonts

- **"Contemporary typography has a huge range of font choices, from the traditional (Times New Roman) to the new (Verdana), and from formal (Constantia) too informal (Comic Sans MS). Your freedom to choose fonts might depend on organizational culture, but there are some safe choices. Fonts like Chalkboard that imitate handwriting may seem like a good change of pace from standard fonts, but when used for long messages, they are hard to read."**
- Recommendations for business writings:

|Printed or On-Screen Documents|Web Documents|
|--|--|
|Times New Roman|Verdana|
|Garamond|Arial|

### Size

- **"In business documents, the size of the font used for text is often too small. A factor you may not think of, particularly if you're young with good eyesight, is that older readers often have trouble reading small type. A good choice for business documents is an 11- or 12-point font size."**

### Emphasis

- **"With the help of computers, writers can create typographic emphasis. Emphasis includes the use of faces, fonts, color, special effects such as shadows, and a long list of other techniques."**
- **"Emphasis in document elements such as headings and exhibits is useful as a meaningful signal to readers. But repeated use of emphasis (for example, bold or italic) in the text of a business document is not a good idea for two reasons. It pulls the eye around the text, disrupting concentration, and it implies that readers won't realize the significance of words or phrases without visual help."**

---

## Writing Style

- **"Writing style refers to how a writer builds sentences. Every writer has developed a writing style of some kind."**
- **"Style can be defined by answers to questions like these:"**
  - Does your writing tend to include short sentences and action verbs, or are you more comfortable with longer sentences and frequent use of passive voice?
  - Do you like to use words that show you have a large vocabulary?
  - Do you write fairly simple sentences or complicated ones?
  - If you are writing English as a second language, does your writing style in your first language have any effect, negative or positive, on your writing style in English?

### A Writing Style for Business

- **"The four qualities of good communication—directness, conciseness, clarity, and logic—define a writing style for business. Remember that you have a restless, easily distracted, and often interrupted reader to satisfy. To achieve the qualities of good communication, use the Writing for Action Style."**
- **"The Writing for Action Style has five building blocks:"**
  - The sentence structure clearly links ideas.
  - Subjects perform actions.
  - Verbs express action.
  - Objects finish the action.
  - Each sentence uses plain language.

### Using the Writing for Action Style

- **"Reminding yourself to use a specific style while writing a draft can interfere with self-expression. Checking the style of each sentence after you write puts thinking on hold. Use the editing stage to streamline sentences in the Writing for Action Style. Over time, your default writing style will improve, reducing the amount of editing you need to do."**
- **"To edit sentences using the Writing for Action Style, use the following five-step process."**

|Step|Editing Action|Example|
|--|--|--|
|1. Find the action.|What is the action in the sentence? Find the main subject and verb.|Quite a few services, most critical, were provided to almost the entire community by the nonprofit.|
|2. Find the main idea.|Identify the “kernel” sentence—all the words expressing the main action: the subject performing the action, the verb that expresses the action, and the object that receives the action.|Quite a few services, most critical, were provided to almost the entire community by the nonprofit.|
|3. Express the action.|When possible, use an action verb to express the action in the kernel sentence.|The nonprofit provided services to the community.|
|4. Assess the rest.|Inspect the sentence for words that add essential meaning.|Quite a few services, most of them critical, were provided to almost the entire community by the nonprofit.|
|5. Add to the kernel.|Integrate the additional essential meaning into the sentence.|The nonprofit provided critical services to the entire community.|

### Passive Voice

- Don't use passive voice sentences in written communication unless it is absolute necessity.
- Passive voice removes the subject performing the action which might add to confusion and invites wordliness.

### Plain Language

- Plain language is essential for good writing style.
- **"In the earlier discussion, a distinction was made between legitimate technical terms that bolster clarity and buzzwords that weaken it. Clichés, euphemisms, and hedge words can also reduce clarity."**
- **"Business buzzword - A business term that might once have had meaning but is now overused or misused."**
- **"Cliché - A trite, overused word or phrase that isn't necessarily specific to business."**
- **"Euphemism - A word or term that obscures or understates a negative or sensitive meaning."**
- **"Hedge word - A word that enables a writer to avoid taking a position."**

#### Business Buzzwords

- **"Business has a large and ever-changing vocabulary of buzzwords."**
- **"Buzzwords often substitute vagueness for clarity. They can be the product of lazy writing—the writer finds it easier to use buzzwords instead of more precise expressions."**

#### Clichés

- They are shortcuts to meanings or prepackaged expressions. They can be tiresome to read.
- **"Clichés can substitute for words that have more meaning for the intended audience."**

#### Euphemisms and Hedge Words

- **"When writers have to express a negative of some kind, they can be tempted to blunt or soften it with euphemisms. Hedge words serve writers by avoiding commitment to a point of view. The techniques can comfort a writer afraid of the audience’s reaction to candor. But they can also lead to the bad habits of blurring the truth and evading responsibility. And your audience may not take you seriously."**

### Tone

- **"Tone is the writer's attitude toward the audience and the subject as conveyed through the message."**
- Every speech have certain kind of tone.
- Calibrate tone according to purpose, audience and topic.
- **"Attitude has a large emotional component. Descriptions of tone use words like friendly, hostile, courteous, detached, humble, confidence, and enthusiastic. We don't choose our feelings; we have them. But we can control how we express feelings in writing."**
- **"Tone can tell the audience that you like them or are disappointed in them."**
- **"Your audience reads tone into written statements. To avoid misunderstandings, give the reader enough information to read the words with your intended tone."**

#### Tone in Writing

- **"Oral communication gives the audience rich information to gauge tone: words, voice, and appearance of the speaker such as facial expression and body posture. In writing, the information is much more limited. Even so, tone can be affected by almost any aspect of writing, from word choice and sentence structure to grammar and punctuation."**
- **"Variables in a communication situation such as your relationship with the audience, status and power differences, age, organizational culture, and national culture can shape tone."**
- **"In the message, the subject, point of view, writing style, and word choice can affect tone."**
- A calm and respectful tone fits in every situation in business.
- **"Consider tone in your writing with these questions:"**
  - What tone best suits my purpose and audience?
  - What other factors about tone, such as status difference, do I need to take into account?
  - Does my writing reflect the tone I intend?
- Guaging our tone is challenging. Our writing may not have the same tone everytime. Read all of the message carefully to gauge the tone or ask feedbacks from other.

---

## Informative Writing

- Purpose of informative writing is to describe or explain an object, location, process, and many other similar subjects.
- **"Description communicates the details, characteristics, parts, and qualities of a person, object, or other subject. Explanation complements description by stating how or why something happens, is created, is performed, is valued, and so forth. In the business world, informative writing often combines description and explanation."**

### Compposing the Informative Memo

- Purpose directs the needed information and content.
- Information has to be callected from all the sources possible. 
- It can also be collected from the people who have pertinent information about the subject.

### Organizing the memo

- Content should be in appropriate quantity, neither too much nor too low.
- **"One benchmark is the average length of memos in your organization that have content comparable to yours. Writing a memo that is much longer or shorter than the norm can violate the audience's expectations and trigger negative reactions. Get to know your organization's norms about the length of documents—they may be unstated. You can please audiences by writing messages more concisely than others, but you shouldn't sacrifice critical points or nuances. At the same time, some topics need more words to do them justice than others. In those cases, let the audience know why extra length is necessary."**

#### Organic and Analytical Organizers

- **"Informative writing in business often describes a process. A key step in creating a writing plan for a process is arranging the steps in the correct order."**
- Use the templates for organizing the message.

### Drafting

- **"A reasonably settled outline or writing plan expedites writing a draft."**
- No need to keep all the points in your head or worry about the order of content while drafting.
