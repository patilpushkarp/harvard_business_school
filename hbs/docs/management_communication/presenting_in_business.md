# Presenting in Business

```{epigraph}
The idea of making a presentation in public is the No. 1 fear reported by people in the U.S.

## Introduction

- Talking is the primary medium of presentation.
- **"A presentation consists of a set of ideas spoken to an audience. The ideas are prepared in advance along with supporting material such as slides."**
- **"By some estimates, 30,000,000 PowerPoint slides are displayed per day."**

### Leading People

- Leaders persuade to motivate people, to align them with organizational goals, and to have them accept new ideas and practices to collaborate and cooperate effectively. 

### Resolving Differences of Opinion

- Employee may disagree about business issues. 
- **"Leaders and managers need to be able to probe, question, and negotiate, but they also need to know how to use persuasion to resolve differences of opinion."**

## Obstacles to Persuasive Presentation

- Following are the obstacles for persuasive presentation:
  - Fear of speaking
  - Overreliance on slides
  - A failure to engage
  - A misconception about persuasion

### Fear of Speaking

- **"Communication apprehension (fear of public speaking) is normal, but it can be a problem when it is intense and chronic. There is even a medical term for extreme cases: glossophobia."**
- **"Being the focus of attention in a room and having sole responsibility for making something happen can stimulate fear. The fear creates a vicious circle. You fear speaking and avoid it, but the more you avoid it, the more you fear it—and the less likely you are to acquire the skills you need that will help reduce the fear."**
- Nervousness is a natural stimulant that enhances performance.
- Fear of speaking is manageable and certain techniques are available to limit it's negative effects.

### Overreliance on Slides

- **"Quite a few speakers have come to regard slides as the presentation, not as a complement to the presentation. And when the attitude that “more is better” encounters feature-rich presentation software, speakers can saturate audiences with information: slide after slide of bullet points, charts, tables, and graphs filled with so much content and formatting clutter that they are unreadable. Slides that convey too much create a dilemma for audience members."**
- Most audiences try to read the slide text or listen to the presenter simutaneously, splitting their attention and lessening the amount of information they can take in.
- **"Presenters can unwittingly use PowerPoint as a means of coping with stage fright. Slides can shift attention away from them. No longer are they speakers connecting with an audience; they are narrators of a slideshow. Even their posture can protect them from contact with the audience. To read the slides, they turn their backs to the listeners."**
- **"Most business audiences have sat through scores of presentations in school and on the job, and the odds are that many of them were boring and delivered too much information. Presentation fatigue is therefore a characteristic of business audiences. Very quickly, audience members can enter a state of minimal attention—a habit formed from many disappointing experiences."**
- Making better use of presentation tools is one solution to "death by PowerPoint".

### The Realities of Attention

- Average adult can concentrate for less than a minute.
- **"The external environment teems with distractions, and a constant stream of thoughts, emotions, memories, data from the senses, and other physical sensations flows through your mind."**
- **"Presenting isn’t about seizing and holding people’s attention continuously for long periods. Presenters must constantly reengage the audience."**

#### Managing Distraction

- Human have three capacity for attention:
  - Alerting: Awareness of one's surroundings, particularly changes in them.
  - Orienting: Attention that allows one to concentrate on something. Also called focus.
  - Executive attention: Attention that helps one to plan and make judgments.
- **"As a presenter you have to accept the reality of distractions and realize you compete with many other stimuli in the environment. The challenge is to stand out from the background noise. The most robust source of engagement and reengagement is not PowerPoint or other media. It is you and your engagement with people in the audience."**

### Misconception About Persuasion

- **"Much writing about persuasion emphasizes winning."**
- Misconception: Persuasion always involves a degree of competition. 

#### Persuasion as Collaboration

- **"You can be a better communicator by thinking of persuasion as collaborating with the audience to accomplish goals that neither party can secure entirely on their own. Defining persuasion in terms of winning or losing can limit your thinking and thwart positive outcomes."**

#### The Dark Side of Winning

- **"The idea that persuasion is about winning or losing has a potential dark side. To win, people can believe that the end justifies the means and take shortcuts such as manipulation, deception, and outright lies."**
- **"The unethical use of persuasion seems to have a natural limit."**

## Analyzing a Communication Situation

- **"Analyzing a communication situation includes understanding the purpose of a presentation and audience characteristics relevant to it, and then using the resources of reason, emotion, and character to create the message. What you learn from the analysis informs both the message—the content of the presentation—and the delivery—the manner in which you communicate it to the audience."**

### Persuasive Presentation

- Persuasive presentation is about the audience.
- **"When communicators persuade, they want something from their audiences—to adopt a desired belief or an attitude, to gain their consent or support. Presenters preoccupied with themselves—their own thoughts and feelings—lose sight of the fact that to satisfy their needs they must satisfy the audience’s needs."**
- "What is in it for the audience?" is the first question that needs to be solved.

### Arguments and Persuasive Presentations

- **"Arguments in a presentation need to be efficient. In business, presenters have a tendency to flood the audience with data and other information. But the more-is-better approach completely ignores the needs of the audience. Speakers, guided by the less-is-more principle, must make hard choices about the content of their arguments."**

### Emotions and Persuasive Presentations

- **"In a persuasive presentation, the communicator wants to align audience members’ feelings with her purpose so that both the arguments she uses and the emotions she evokes pull the audience toward the same destination: accepting the presenter’s conclusion."**
- **"Emotions—the audience’s and yours—can be hard to understand and even harder to influence, but they have a key role in persuasion."**

### Character and Persuasive Presentations

- **"To improve your persuasion abilities, you need to learn how to shape audience members’ attitude toward you. An audience always has an attitude toward a speaker. You want to foster a favorable attitude toward you."**

#### The Halo Effect and Its Opposite

- Halo effect is beneficial for the communicator and reverse halo can be detrimental.
- **"When the audience does not know you, their first impressions can function like a halo effect. According to researchers, people make a global evaluation of a stranger in a tenth of a second. They obviously make that judgment based on very limited information: your facial expression, posture, clothes, and movement."**
- **"Studies have shown that first impressions are remarkably durable and hard to change. A positive first impression can be a long-lasting asset for a speaker, while a negative one can be a serious liability."**

#### Facing a Hostile Audience

- **"Provocative audience members can lead you to responses that sour the attitudes of all audience members toward you."**
- **"Try to keep in mind that negative feelings toward someone in the audience will distract you from what you are there for: to address everyone in the room, not spar with one member. You may not be able to persuade everyone. Do your best, but you should not halt your presentation to try to convince one person."**
- **Practical suggestions for responding to hostile audience behavior:"**
  - Disagreement: Someone interrupts you to dispute what you are saying. If the person has a legitimate point, acknowledge it (for example, “You have a point and thanks for sharing it”) and resume your presentation. When you think the objection is not valid, acknowledge it by saying something innocuous (for example, “That is an interesting point”) and move on.
  - Interruptions: An individual either starts talking and will not stop or frequently interrupts. Ask the person to talk to you after the presentation. If that does not solve the problem, say something like: “I want everyone to hear my ideas and decide for themselves whether they make sense. I’d like you to listen to the rest of my presentation and then we can talk afterward.”
  - Arguments: An audience member becomes argumentative. Grant her the right to an opinion, recognize the difference between the two of you, and move on. If the individual persists in arguing, try the approach described in the previous suggestion.
  - Side Conversation: Two people in the audience talk to each other during your presentation. Ignore brief conversations, but when individuals persist in talking, walk toward them and make and hold eye contact.

## The Message: Organizing the Content

- **"The ICAA organizer, or template, stands for Issue-Conclusion-Argument-Action. It is designed for persuasive presentations and provides a shortcut for creating ideas and arranging them."**
- Components of ICAA:
  - Issue: The issue needs resolution and you should be able to express it in one or two sentences. Stating it as a question can often be helpful to the audience.
  - Conclusion: The conclusion is your answer regarding the issue. You should be able to state it in one or a few sentences.
  - Argument: The argument consists of the reasoning and evidence that back up the conclusion.
  - Action: The action portion of the presentation specifies how to implement the conclusion. It corresponds to a written action plan, except that it is not as detailed. You can offer the audience a written plan as a handout.

### Why Not Start with PowerPoint?

- **"Note that the development of a presentation begins with creating and organizing ideas, not with PowerPoint or other presentation software."**
- **"When used well, slides visually reinforce the essential ideas of a presentation. A presentation begun in PowerPoint starts with the reinforcement rather than the ideas and fosters the view that the slides are the presentation. That view may encourage a presenter to build a large slide deck crammed with information. And it may undercut a presenter’s motivation to engage with the people in the room."**
- **"A large body of research demonstrates that people learn more through a combination of sight and hearing than through one or the other alone. Slides therefore have an essential function as a learning channel parallel to speech—but not superior to it."**

### Putting the Conclusion Last

- **"In some cultures, speakers are expected to reveal their thinking gradually and defer a conclusion until the end or imply a conclusion but never state it in so many words."**
- **"Presenters can also employ the conclusion-last organization as an inductive approach to proof:"**
  - Issue: First, they state the issue.
  - Argument: Second, they argue against the major opposing opinions.
  - Argument: Third, they argue for their conclusion.
  - Conclusion: Fourth, they state the conclusion.
  - Action: Finally, they discuss actions based on the conclusion.
- **"If you decide to put your conclusion at the end of a presentation, the essential content of the argument remains the same as the conclusion-first presentation. However, The ICAA organizer has a slightly different order."**

### How Much Evidence?

- **"Business presenters often immerse audiences in large bodies of data. However, an oral presentation, even one that uses visuals, is not an effective medium for large amounts of data."**
- **"An orally delivered argument still requires proof, just as one in writing does."**
- Amount of evidence required depends on the audience.

### Openings

- A real-world audience can refuse whatever you are asking of them.
- **"For the content of the opening, ask what you think the audience most wants to talk about, the most common question they have in mind, or the most serious reservation they have about your topic."**
- **"At some point in the opening of the presentation, you should also state the issue and your conclusion and furnish a simple roadmap of the presentation—the major points of interest on the trip to the destination."**

### Closings

- **"At the end of the presentation, leave the audience with a concise memory of the points you most want them to remember. A visual can be used for this purpose. A striking image, a brief story, and an emotional appeal connected to the key points are just a few ways to fix your core message in the listeners’ memories."**
- **"Speaking past the scheduled end of the presentation violates an implicit contract with audience members. The speaker agreed to a presentation of a certain length and the audience members planned accordingly; then the speaker changes the contract without their consent. Audiences do not appreciate a speaker unwilling to let go of them."**

## The Message: Preparing the Plan

- **Although the length of a presentation depends on many variables, such as audience interest in the topic and the nature of the content, keep it as short as possible. You can use a target of 18 minutes. Rarely do audiences complain about presentations being too short.**
- **Auditory memory is more limited than visual memory. Although a good presentation has visuals, you communicate most of it through speech.**
- **Presenters also have to contend with the time an audience can concentrate. As you have learned, every speaker is engaged in a continuous competition for audience members' attention, attracting it, losing it, and bringing it back. No matter how good a presenter you are, you can only expect to draw listeners back so many times. The longer you talk, the more likely you are to lose the struggle for attention."**
- **"Here is a seven-step process for planning and creating a presentation:"**
  1. Generate ideas and take notes.
  2. Group content.
  3. Create the presentation plan.
  4. Plan slides and other media.
  5. Prepare slides and other media.
  6. Edit the presentation.
  7. Practice the presentation.

### Generate Ideas and Take Notes

- **In whatever medium you are comfortable—paper, word processing, or mind-mapping software—list ideas for the content of the presentation. Don’t worry about the order of the notes—capture ideas whenever they come to mind. Be as detailed as you want.**
- **"Set aside your notes and take a break. When you return to them, you’ll bring a fresh perspective. Wait until the next day if possible. The phrase "sleep on it" is good advice, according to neuroscience. When we sleep, we seem to consolidate and stabilize memories."**

### Group Content

- **"As you review your notes, think about your purpose for presenting. Write it down—you should be able to express your purpose in one or two sentences."**
- Always step back and think about the best way to communicate the prepared slides.

### Create the Presentation Plan

- **"Create a simple outline from the notes. The groups of related content you identified in the last step will be the major parts of the presentation. Put them in the order they will be presented. The plan should be sufficiently detailed to remind you of the key points. You should not write a word-for-word script because a presentation is not a speech."**
- **"If the content comes from a document, review the organization carefully. You may find that it needs to be in a different order for oral communication."**
- **"Again, take a break or set aside the plan until the next day. Check it and rearrange as necessary. You may need to fill in gaps that the plan has exposed. Now think about how you will open and close, including any media elements. Add the ideas to the plan."**

### Plan Slides and Other Media

- **"Review the notes you have made about media and add or subtract visuals or other reinforcement that you think will help. Do not limit your thinking about media to slides. Consider video, web content, pictures, props, and flip charts."**
- **"Use a storyboard to capture your ideas for slides and other visuals. Sticky notes are a handy way to create one. Write ideas for slides or visuals on notes and stick them on a piece of paper in the order you will use them. You can replace notes, remove them, and rearrange them."**
- For presentation, have clear concise storyline and simplify.

### Prepare Slides and Other Media

- **"When you’re satisfied with the storyboard, use PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, or a similar application to copy the key point of each sticky note into a new slide file. On each slide, type the main idea, such as an image, text, or a chart, and then build it."**
- **"Most presentation software uses the single-slide format. The online application Prezi takes a different approach, giving you a visual space with which to work. You fill in different areas of the space with groups of content. For the presentation, you move from one grouping to another."**
- **"Go back to the storyboard and start work on any other media you will use. For instance, say that you will be presenting a series of innovative ideas generated internally to interest department heads in funding them. You could describe each one with bullet point slides. But you think the people behind the ideas are as important as the ideas. Having them each present in the room would be unwieldy. Instead, you can make short videos of each person explaining her or his idea. You have to decide when in the presentation to show the videos and plan their production."**

### Edit the Presentation

- **"To start the editing process, estimate the time of each part of the presentation. “Talk the presentation” from beginning to end. That means speaking out loud."**
- **"In your estimate of the time, include the time needed for the discussion of each slide, audience participation, use of props, and any in-session logistics such as telling the audience how to operate a handheld device they will use for a poll."**
- **"Your time estimates will help you determine whether you have too much or too little material. Edit your written presentation plan first, then the slides and other media, making them as lean as possible. Presenters typically overestimate the amount of content they can deliver comfortably in a given period of time—sometimes by a large margin."**
- **"Walk trusted colleagues or friends through the presentation and the slides and ask if they think anything is missing or can be dropped. Listen to them carefully. A slide filled with data you think is absolutely crucial may be, in their eyes, impossible to understand."**

### Practice the Presentation

- **"Rehearse the presentation out loud with slides and other media as often as you can. Practice how you are going to express your ideas, make sure the presentation doesn’t run too short or long, and orchestrate other presentation elements such as slides and props. Practicing can increase confidence and reduce nervousness."**

## The Message: Enriching the Presentation

- **"During the planning of a presentation, keep in mind that you have many choices for adding texture, energy, and interest. You do not have to settle for bland explanation and bullet point slides."**

### Energizing the Speech Channel

- **"You can enliven the speaking part of a presentation with storytelling, audience participation, handouts, and vivid language."**

#### Storytelling

- **"Humans seem to have an inherent interest in stories. When someone starts to tell a story, we generally want to hear how it ends. We watch, read, or listen to thousands upon thousands of stories during our lifetimes and never seem to tire of them. As a presenter, you can use stories to galvanize the attention of people in the room."**
- **"Stories help both speakers and listeners remember details. Stories seem to promote longer-term memories in several ways, one of which is the stimulation of emotions. It is no accident that for thousands of years, preliterate societies told or sang stories to communicate information across generations."**

#### Audience Participation

- **"Audience participation makes presentations two way and stimulates active engagement."**
- **"Here are some ways of directly involving the members of your audience:"**
  - Ask a question.
  - Present a problem and ask for solutions.
  - Take a poll. (You can use handheld digital devices for this.)
  - Ask them to generate ideas with you.
- **"To avoid making the presentation too long, audience participation should not require too much time. It should also be voluntary for the audience—you don’t want to put anyone on the spot."**
- **"Whatever form the participation takes, it should be connected—and stay connected—to the content. Audience members can slide off onto tangents or irrelevant topics. Be ready to steer the discussion back to the subject or take back the floor. You are responsible to the entire audience and have to protect the time needed to deliver your message."**

#### Handouts

- **"Handouts can reduce the content load of the spoken portion of a presentation, and thus allow time for activities that enliven it."**
- **"Handouts can be a takeaway reminder of your key points. They can also furnish additional information or evidence that you do not want to include in the presentation."**
- **"Presentation software can print slides, but using them as handouts forces you to make many copies and audience members end up with a stack of paper. Preparing an outline of the presentation in a word-processing program means less paper and more convenience for audiences."**
- **"The best time to distribute handouts is at the end of the presentation, not the beginning. An audience with handouts will be reading them much of the time rather than looking at you."**

#### Vivid Language: Quotations

- **"Quotations from experts or famous individuals lend credibility to your point of view. Because of the speaker’s authority, a quote can have a greater impact on an audience than your own words."**

#### Vivid Language: Analogies

- **"Analogies compare two things, usually to identify similarities. Analogies can be useful because people learn new ideas better when they can connect them to something they already know."**

#### Vivid Language: Metaphors

- **"Metaphors describe something using language unrelated to what is being described. Metaphors can make language more memorable for an audience. Often, they have an emotional impact, too."**

### Energizing the Visual Channel

- **"As you know, audiences learn more through the dual channels of hearing and sight than from one or the other. You can use the visual channel for content other than slides, props, and handouts."**
- **"A quick and simple method for adding visual content to a presentation is the traditional flip chart. Like slides, use them to communicate key points. Flip charts can also be used in conjunction with audience participation. For instance, if you ask the audience a question, you can record responses on the flip chart."**

#### Images

- **"With or without words, images can be emotionally evocative. Get in the practice of exercising your visual imagination."**

#### Charts and Other Graphics

- **"Quantitative information expresses relationships and relationships usually make good visuals. Spreadsheets serve a purpose in handouts, but they are ill suited to presentations because of their visual complexity."**
- **"From spreadsheets and other structured arrangements of numbers, extract the relationships of greatest importance to the presentation: major differences or similarities, relevant increases and decreases, notable trends, critical sequences, and the like."**

#### Videos

- **"Video has become a valuable tool for communicating with business audiences. Cellphone video cameras have gotten better and video-editing software is cheaper and easier to use. In addition, some screen-capture applications can create videos for presentations."**
- **"Even so, video has to be used carefully, like any other visual content. You should take the less-is-more approach. Video clips should be short—under 30 seconds. Poor-quality video can make the presentation seem unprofessional."**
- **"Say that your presentation requires the explanation of a highly technical financial concept. Instead of trying to explain the concept yourself, you can record an in-house expert explaining the point and play the video during the presentation."**

#### Internet-Based Technologies

- Potential internert-based technologies that can be used during preaentation:
  - Youtube: For posting videos.
  - Skype: Conferencing application to interact with expert.
  - Internet Databases: Structured data can be directly used in the presentations sometimes.
- **"Technical malfunctions can make using online material perilous. You have to manage the details of web technology before and during the presentation, just like you do display equipment in the room. In addition, you need a contingency plan for technical failures."**

#### Props and Demonstrations

- **"Props can be used in presentations to illustrate a point, reinforce the message, and capture audience members’ attention."**

## The Message: Preparing Slides and Other Media

- **"Slides should be at the end of your presentation to-do list."**
- **"When you start to design slides, do not allow the need for handouts to constrain you. Presenters often use printed versions of their slides as handouts. But effective designs do not necessarily print well. Slides with a solid dark background may be nearly illegible when printed on a black-and-white printer."**
- **"To solve the design conflict between slides and handouts, create separate handouts in a word-processing program."**

### Slides as Organizers

- **"The visual nature of slides makes them well suited to organizing a presentation for listeners."**
- **"At the beginning of a presentation, provide a roadmap slide of what you are going to say; at the end, provide a summary slide of the points you want the audience to remember. In the body of the presentation, sign post slides tell the audience where they are."**

### Number of Slides

- **"Here is a process for keeping your slide count under control. Imagine that you aren’t going to use any slides for a presentation. Then ask these questions:"**
  - What are the points I will have the hardest time getting across to the audience using only spoken words? Create slides for these points.
  - What emotions that align with my purpose could I draw out better using slides instead of spoken words alone? Build emotion into the slides you’ve already created or create new ones.
  - What additional slides do I need to assist the audience? Examples are the roadmap and summary slides.

### Lead Lines and Bullet Points

- **"PowerPoint templates for formatting slide titles assume a headline of a few words. However, in the report of a 2005 study, investigators concluded that one or two full sentences at the top of a slide are better memory aids than headlines. They added a caveat: These lead line sentences need to be short."**
- **"Not all slides serve the same purpose, however, and some do not need a lead line."**
- **"Probably the majority of presentation slides you have seen had bullet points with a title. For presenters, bullet points let them put a lot of information on a slide. For the audience, they pose a problem. Too often slides have too many bullet points with too much text in each item. Not only do these slides tax the concentration of the audience; but they also are not efficient. Most audiences will remember little or nothing of the detail on them."**
- **"Try to limit use of the bullet point design. In many cases, you can do without bullets by putting a single concept on a slide and telling the audience the details."**
- **"When you do use bullet points, keep the items short. When you show the slide, use the “Build” function to display bullet points one at a time. Literate adults automatically read written language. A slide that displays all of the bullet points at once forces viewers to read them, which can cause information overload."**

### Slide Animation

- **"Presentation software has many different slide animations, including multiple options for moving text, images, or objects onto the screen. Some animations like builds (the sequential appearance of items) can be useful."**
- **"Animation can divert audience members’ attention from the content. And animation quickly becomes stale with repeated use. Animation also takes time; if it is used on many slides, it can lengthen the presentation considerably. Use slide animation sparingly, if at all."**

### Designing Effective Slides

- **"Effective slides have these essential qualities:"**
  - Relevance
  - Simplicity and clarity
  - Forcefulness
  - Readability
- **"To design effective presentation slides, use the following questions as a guide:"**
  - What is the essential point I want to convey with each slide?
  - What is the minimum information necessary to understand that point?
  - How can I communicate the required information in the most visual way possible? What are the alternatives to bullet points or data-infested charts and tables?
  - What other means can I use to share information too dense for a slide? Alternatives include a handout, a document that includes backup information related to the presentation, or a link to a webpage that includes the information.

#### Relevance

- **"People retain more of a presentation’s content when the visual and speech channels reinforce each other. Visual content irrelevant to the spoken content actually reduces retention."**

#### Simplicity and Clarity

- **"Simplicity has two dimensions: a manageable amount of information and uncomplicated design. A slide with clarity immediately communicates its meaning."**
- **"Good presenters have great faith in their ability to use the data rather than merely display it. They break down complexity into smaller pieces and show how they fit together."**
- **"The culture of complexity isn't going to yield overnight, but you can be part of furthering a culture of clarity."**

#### Forcefulness

- **"Slides can have a significant impact on audience members. Skilled presenters use less text and exploit the power of images and sound to make an impression."**

#### Readability

- **"The benchmark for readability is a yes answer to the following question: Can the person farthest away from the screen read the slides easily?"**
- **"To fit a large amount of text on a slide, the size of the type has to be small. Small type makes slide text hard to read."**
- **"Don't use type smaller than 18 points."**
- **"A second good practice is to have a clear contrast between the type and the background. A lack of contrast reduces readability."**
