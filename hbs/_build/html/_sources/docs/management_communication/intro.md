- Communication is an inseparable part of any organization and encompasses all the stakeholders such as vendors, regulators, customers, and shareholders. 
- Communication can be verbal (one on one, meetings, presentations etc.) or written (emails, reports, texts, blogs, tweets, other work-related documents etc.)
-  It is necessary to get things done without emphasizing power and authority and by trusting others. In curernt era, it is necessary for employees to think and act on their own. Thus, managing boils down to influencing action.
-  Communication, written or oral, is the primary means to influence action.
-  Professional success is guided by:
   1. Character and Integrity
   2. Capabilities
   3. Communication skills
