# Calculus

- A non linear function will never have a constant slop line a straight line. 
- **"A branch of mathematics concerned with determining the slope of a function at any point. Knowledge of differential calculus enables us to easily maximize and minimize functions and also graph complicated functions."**

## Motivation for Differential Calculus

- It is necessary in businesses to know some minimum and maximum point of a function defining a system. 
- **"The maximum or minimum value of a function is the point at which the slope of the curve is zero."**
- The slope of the function at $x$ can be approximated by the slope of the line joining $(x, f(x))$ and $(x+\Delta x, f(x + \Delta x))$, as $\Delta x$ tends to $0$.
- Making $\Delta x$ approach to 0 is equivalent to taking first order derivative of the function $f(x)$.

## Slope and Tangent Lines

- **"The slope of a function at a given point can be shown visually by drawing a line such that it touches the function only at that point. That line is called tangent."**
- **"When the two points come together, Δx becomes zero, the line becomes a tangent line, and the slope of the function at that now-single point is revealed."**
- **"The point where the function shifts from increasing values of y to decreasing values of y (or from decreasing values of y to increasing values of y) is where the slope of the tangent line equals zero — i.e., where the tangent line is horizontal."**

## Rules for Computing Derivatives

- $dy/dx$ is used as notation for derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$.
- $dy/dx = y' = f'(x)$
- If $f'(x) > 0$, the function is increasing at $x$, and that if $f'(x) < 0$, the function is decreasing at $x$. 
- Rule 1: If $f(x) = k$ then $y' = 0$.
- Rule 2: If $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a any number, then $y' = nx^{n-1}$
- Rule 3: If $f(x)=kg(x)$, then $y' = kg'(x)$ where $g'(x)$ is the derivative of $g(x)$.
- Rule 4: If $f(x) = g(x) + h(x)$, then $f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)$.

## Second Derivatives, Convex and Concave Functions

- Sometimes it is necessary to maximize a function or minimize a function.
- Concave functions can be easily maximized while convex functions can be easily minimized.
- To determine whether a function is convex or concave, second derivative ($y''$) is used.
- $d^2y/d^2x = y'' = f''(x)$.
- Second derivative is the derivative of first derivative of a function.
- **"When a function's second derivative is positive, the function's first derivative is increasing; when a function's second derivative is negative, the function's first derivative is decreasing."**
- **"A function $f(x)$ is convex if for all values of $x$, $f"(x) ≥ 0$."**
- **"A function $f(x)$ is concave if for all values of $x$, $f"(x) ≤ 0$."** 

## Maximizing and Minimizing Functions

- **"A concave function attains its maximum value at any point where $f'(x) = 0$."**
- **"A convex function attains its minimum value at any point where $f'(x) = 0$."

## Inflection Points

- **"A point where a curve changes from being convex to concave or concave to convex is an inflection point."**
- An infletion point exist at $f''(x)=0$.
